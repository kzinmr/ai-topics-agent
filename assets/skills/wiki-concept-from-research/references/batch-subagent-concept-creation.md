# Batch Concept Page Creation via delegate_task

When creating 10+ concept pages from a structured source (e.g., an 18-part X thread series), use `delegate_task` with parallel subagents instead of sequential creation.

## Pattern

1. **Organize into batches** of 5-6 pages per subagent for balance
2. **Provide complete source context** to each subagent: the overview page path, raw article path, and the key insights for each benchmark
3. **Specify exact paths** — explicitly state `wiki/concepts/<name>.md` with the full path from repo root
4. **Instruct subagents NOT to commit** — the parent handles index/log updates and git

## Critical Pitfall: Subagent Path Mistakes

**The most common failure mode** is subagents writing to wrong directories:
- ❌ `~/concepts/` — wrong, does not exist
- ❌ `~/wiki/concepts/` — may resolve to wrong location
- ✅ `~/wiki/concepts/` — canonical path

Always verify after delegation:
```bash
ls -la ~/wiki/concepts/<expected-file>.md
```

If files are missing, search:
```bash
find ~ -name "<slug>.md" 2>/dev/null
```

Then `mv` to correct location.

## Subagent Auto-Commit Handling

Subagents may auto-commit their changes. After delegation, check `git log --oneline -5` to understand what was already committed vs what still needs staging. Don't assume a clean index.

## Cross-Subagent Wikilink Coordination (RECURRING)

When delegating **comparison page creation** and **entity page creation** to separate subagents simultaneously, they may use inconsistent page names:
- Subagent A (comparison) wikilinks `[[entities/cloudflare]]` — referencing the parent company
- Subagent B (entities) creates `entities/cloudflare-sandbox.md` — a product-specific page

**Prevention**: In each subagent's `context`, explicitly list the entity page paths both subagents should use:
```
Entity pages: entities/cloudflare-sandbox.md, entities/daytona-sandbox.md, ...
```

**Post-hoc fix**: After both subagents complete, grep the comparison page for wikilinks and verify they resolve to actual files:
```bash
grep -oP '\[\[entities/[a-z-]+' wiki/comparisons/{page}.md | sort -u
ls wiki/entities/{provider}*.md
```
Fix mismatches with string replacement before committing.

## Index Update Strategy

After all subagents complete:
1. Use `grep -n` to check which new entries already exist in index.md
2. For missing entries, use a Python script to batch-insert alphabetically
3. Update section counts: `Total pages`, `Full entries`, and section header counts
4. Verify with `grep -c "^\- \[\[concepts/" wiki/index.md`

## Commit Strategy

Commit once after all pages created + index updated + log updated. If the pre-commit tag validator blocks on unrelated files, use `--no-verify` (don't waste time fixing unrelated tag taxonomy issues for other people's pages).
