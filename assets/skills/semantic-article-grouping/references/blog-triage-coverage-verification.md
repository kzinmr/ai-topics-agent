# Blog Triage: Coverage Verification Workflow

This reference covers the **blog triage cross-reference verification** workflow — how to efficiently determine whether blog articles are already captured in existing wiki pages. For newsletter triage (Substack/Beehiiv noise filtering, URL resolution), see the main SKILL.md body.

## Overview

Blog triage has a higher "already covered" rate than newsletter triage because prolific bloggers (Simon Willison, Ed Zitron, etc.) are tracked as wiki entities with comprehensive article summaries. In a typical batch of 19 articles, expect:
- ~5-8 already captured in entity pages (reference/skip)
- ~1 with genuine new value (take)
- ~10 non-AI content (skip)

## Step-by-Step Verification

### 1. Same-Day Check (30s)

```bash
# Two-pronged: date grep + source name grep
grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" ~/wiki/log.md | head -20
grep -i "simonwillison\|wheresyoured\|krebson\|daringfireball" ~/wiki/log.md
```

Look for lines like `## 2026-05-13 - Blog Ingest` followed by ingestion records. If `blog-wiki-ingest` already ran, the data is consumed.

### 2. Batch-Read Articles (parallel)

Read 5 articles at a time via `read_file`, prioritizing:
1. High-frequency sources first (simonwillison.net, wheresyoured.at — likely entity-covered)
2. AI-relevant-title first (anything mentioning "AI", "model", "agent", "security", "GPT", "Claude")
3. Non-AI sources last (johndcook.com, dfarq.homeip.net — quick skip)

### 3. Verify Against Entity Pages

For high-frequency sources (Simon Willison, Ed Zitron), the entity page is where article summaries accumulate:

```python
# Efficient batch check: grep all article titles from entity page
terminal(f"grep -i 'article-title-keyword' ~/wiki/entities/{entity}.md")
```

**Do NOT stop at "URL present"** — verify the entity page has actual content sections with the article's claims. A listing in `sources:` frontmatter or `References:` section without a summary means the article is NOT yet captured.

Key verification levels:

| Entity Page Has | Verdict |
|----------------|---------|
| Dedicated section with substantive summary | ✅ Already captured (reference) |
| Article URL in `sources:` frontmatter only | ⚠️ Not captured (potential take) |
| Generic heading, no specific claims/data | ⚠️ Not captured (potential take) |
| Mentioned in References list only | ⚠️ Not captured (potential take) |

### 4. Verify Against Concept Pages

For event-based articles (Patch Tuesdays, model releases, Glasswing updates), check concept pages:

```python
terminal(f"grep -i 'keyword' ~/wiki/concepts/{concept}.md | head -10")
```

Example: Krebs Patch Tuesday article → check `concepts/project-glasswing.md` for "Real-World Impact" section.

### 5. Verify Against Alternative Entities

Some articles may be captured under a different author's entity page:
- `wheresyoured.at` articles → `entities/ed-zitron.md` (not a separate "wheresyoured" entity)
- `daringfireball.net` articles → may be in `concepts/nextpad-ai-development.md` (not just Gruber's entity)

### 6. Terminal Fallback

When `search_files` returns false negatives (known pitfall):

```bash
# Direct filesystem find
find ~/wiki/concepts -name "*keyword*" 2>/dev/null
find ~/wiki/entities -name "*keyword*" 2>/dev/null
# Quick entity listing
ls -lt ~/wiki/entities/ | head -20
```

## Common Patterns in Blog Triage

### Simon Willison (always check first)
His entity page (`entities/simon-willison.md`, ~300 lines) accumulates ALL his May 2026+ output with dedicated sections. If the article is from simonwillison.net, it's almost certainly already there — verify by reading entity content, not assuming.

### Ed Zitron / wheresyoured.at
Entity `entities/ed-zitron.md` has a "Data Center Construction Investigation" section that captures his major investigative pieces. Short commentary posts may not be captured.

### Krebs / Glasswing
`concepts/project-glasswing.md` has a "Real-World Impact: May 2026 Patch Data" section that already captures all Glasswing-related Patch Tuesday data (Microsoft 118, Firefox 271, Apple 52, Oracle 450+, Chrome 127).

### Daring Fireball + Nextpad++
`concepts/nextpad-ai-development.md` was created to capture the Nextpad++ story. Daring Fireball articles about it are sources for the concept page, not separate entity entries.

## Edge Cases Discovered in Practice

### Timeline Entry ≠ Content Capture (antirez DS4 — May 2026)

The antirez entity page (`entities/antirez-com.md`) had `| 2026 | Published "A few words on DS4"` in its **Timeline table** — a publication event marker, not content capture. The DS4 launch contained significant technical details (2/8-bit asymmetric quantization with DeepSeek V4 Flash on 96-128GB RAM, distributed inference plans, coding agent integration) that were absent from the entity page despite the article being "acknowledged" in the timeline.

**Rule**: A Timeline table entry is a publication signal only. It indicates the author's output was noted, not that the content was extracted. Treat it as equivalent to "URL in sources frontmatter" (not captured). Read the entity page's substantive sections (Core Ideas, dedicated prose sections) to determine true coverage.

### Vendor-Specific Concept Page vs General Analysis (Martin Alderson Managed Agents — May 2026)

The `concepts/managed-agents.md` page was about **Anthropic's specific managed agents product** (Brain/Hands/Session architecture). Martin Alderson's article covered the **general managed-agent pattern** — comparing it to AWS Lambda, discussing vendor lock-in across all providers, Anthropic pricing changes, self-hosting with OpenCode, and Cloudflare/Vercel competitors.

**Rule**: When a concept page is vendor-specific (check frontmatter `aliases` and `tags` for hints — e.g., `Managed Agents (Anthropic)`), a blog article about the broader category may still represent a wiki gap. If the article covers cross-provider analysis, vendor-independent strategy, or the general phenomenon, it needs its own section or a separate general page.

### Consecutive Follow-Up Articles on Same Event — New Technical Depth (Jul 2026)

When a prolific blogger publishes **multiple articles on the same ongoing incident** over several days, earlier articles may have been used to create an event/concept page, but **later articles can contain significant new technical details** that warrant enrichment rather than a skip.

**Concrete case**: Simon Willison published three articles on the OpenAI/Hugging Face agent intrusion incident (July 2026):
- Jul 22 — Initial analysis (→ used to create `events/openai-huggingface-incident-july-2026.md`)
- Jul 23 — "First known runaway AI agent" (→ also incorporated into event page)
- Jul 28 — "Technical Timeline" with NEW details not in earlier articles: JFrog Artifactory 7.161.15 with 8 CVEs credited to OpenAI, Jinja2 template injection payload (`cycler.__init__.__globals__`), Python socket monkey-patching (`socket.getaddrinfo = lambda...`), Tailscale exfiltration, Modal confirmation as third-party provider, Hugging Face "machine-speed offense" quote

**Detection**: When you see an article referencing an incident already documented in an event page, check:
1. Article publication date vs event page's `created` date
2. Does the event page's `sources` list earlier articles by the same author on the same topic?
3. If the article is **newer** than the event page, read it for new technical depth

**Decision rule**:
- Zero new facts beyond the event page → Skip
- Modest new context/framing → Reference for `entities/{author}.md`
- Concrete new technical details (CVE numbers, exploit payloads, provider confirmations) → Reference for BOTH `entities/{author}.md` AND the event page (update `updated` + `sources`)

This pattern is about **temporal depth**: a follow-up that became available only because the story developed between the first and later articles. Distinct from "broader-section mention" or "mentioned ≠ covered."

### Same-Name, Different-Project (DS4 × 2 — May 2026)

The existing `concepts/ds4-deepseek-flash-metal.md` described **Armin Ronacher's fork** (ds4.c — Apple Silicon Metal optimization). antirez's new article was about his own **DwarfStar 4** (the original project, not the fork). Both share the "DS4" shorthand but are separate projects.

**Rule**: When a new article has the same name/acronym as an existing concept page, verify whether they refer to the same project by reading both the existing page's `sources` frontmatter (reveals which project it covers) and the new article's content. Different projects sharing a name require a separate page, not an update to the existing one.

### Blog-Specific Yield Adjustment

In a May 2026 batch of 20 blog articles from 14 sources, realized yields were:
- 3 Takes (antirez DS4, Apple M5 exploit, Martin Alderson managed agents)
- 6 References (Simon Willison×3, AI safety institute, Musk trial, Nesbitt)
- 11 Skips

This is significantly more takes than the reference's "Mixed batch: 1 take, 8 refs, 10 skips" guideline. Reason: Wednesday May 14 was an unusually high-content day with major AI developments (DS4 launch, M5 exploit). **The yield guidance is a baseline — actual yield varies with news velocity.**

## Page Depth Verification Technique (Dreaming-Group Validated)

When checking whether an existing wiki page already covers a topic, use this 3-step technique to quickly classify pages as "substantively covered" vs "stub/needs enrichment":

### Step 1: Line Count Check
```bash
wc -l ~/wiki/concepts/{page}.md ~/wiki/entities/{page}.md 2>/dev/null
```
- **<60 lines**: Effectively a stub — treat as "not covered" even if the page exists
- **60-150 lines**: May have partial coverage — proceed to Step 2
- **>150 lines**: Likely substantive — proceed to Step 2 to confirm

### Step 2: Keyword Presence Check
```bash
grep -c "specific-term" ~/wiki/concepts/{page}.md 2>/dev/null
```
- **0 matches**: Topic keyword absent — genuine gap regardless of page size
- **1-2 matches**: Likely just a mention in sources/References — read content to confirm
- **3+ matches**: Probably covered — read content to confirm depth

### Step 3: Frontmatter + Content Spot-Check
```bash
# Check status and sources
head -20 ~/wiki/concepts/{page}.md | grep -A5 "sources:\|status:"
# Check for content sections matching the article's topic
grep -A2 "## .*keyword" ~/wiki/concepts/{page}.md
```

### Decision Matrix

| Line Count | Keyword Count | Verdict |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| <60 | any | ★★★★☆ — stub, needs enrichment |
| 60-150 | 0 | ★★★★☆ — topic absent from substantial page |
| 60-150 | 1-2 | ★★★☆☆ — read body to confirm depth |
| 60-150 | 3+ | ★★☆☆☆ — likely covered, verify |
| >150 | 0 | ★★★★☆ — genuine gap in comprehensive page |
| >150 | 1-2 | ★★★☆☆ — mention only, check if substantive |
| >150 | 3+ | ★★☆☆☆ — skip unless article adds new data |

**Concrete validation (June 2026 dreaming-group)**: This technique classified 281 articles in ~10 minutes:
- `search-as-code.md` (204 lines, 0 missing keywords) → skip (fully covered)
- `cursor-composer-2-5.md` (53 lines) → take (stub, needs enrichment)
- `microsoft-mai-models.md` (70 lines, MAI-Thinking-1 keywords present) → skip (covered by mai-thinking-1-tech-report.md 220 lines)
- `agentic-engineering.md` (219 lines, Van Horn hacks all present) → skip (fully covered)

### Simon Willison Model-Release Coverage Pattern (validated July 2026)

When a major model release (Claude Sonnet 5, Fable 5, GPT-5.x) lands on the same day, **both the blog pipeline (Simon Willison) and newsletter pipeline (AINews, Ben's Bites) cover it independently**. The typical blog triage question is: is Simon's article a take (new concept), a reference (entity enrichment), or already captured?

**Decision rule**: Simon's technical analysis of new models — tokenizer benchmarks, pricing analysis, API change observations, government/regulatory context — is best treated as **entity-page enrichment** (★★★☆☆ reference for `entities/simon-willison.md`), not concept creation. Reasons:
- The newsletter pipeline (AINews daily bulletins) reliably creates concept pages for major model releases (e.g., `concepts/claude/sonnet-5.md`)
- Simon's value add is his **hands-on testing data** (token counts per language, pricing sensitivity analysis) — material the AINews curator doesn't produce
- The entity page's "June 2026 Updates" section is the natural home for this granular, measurement-first reporting

**When to upgrade to take (★★★★☆)**: If Simon's article contains the ONLY hands-on measurements available — e.g., Sonnet 5 tokenizer benchmarks showing English 1.42x, Chinese 1.01x, Python 1.28x token growth. These are wiki-primary-source data points that only exist because he ran his Claude Token Counter tool. They belong in both the entity page (as Simon's finding) AND as a `body_sources` reference in the concept page.

### Educational Series Author as Take Signal (validated July 2026)

A technical/educational series author publishing regularly on LLM training, inference, or agent infrastructure may have **no existing entity page** despite producing substantive content. Signal indicators:
- 2000+ lines per article (e.g., Giles Thomas's LLM-from-scratch series: 2808 lines in part 34a)
- 30+ parts in an ongoing series
- Cross-framework educational value (e.g., JAX/NNX/Optax version of a PyTorch-based curriculum)
- No existing wiki entity for the author

**Decision rule**: Rate as ★★★★★ take (new entity creation). The entity page documents the series as a whole (methodology, framework choices, unique insights) rather than each individual part. This is distinct from high-frequency bloggers (Simon Willison, Ed Zitron) whose entity pages already exist — educational series authors represent a **entity gap that blog triage is uniquely positioned to find** because the newsletter pipeline rarely covers them.

## Yield Expectations

| Source Type | Typical Batch | Takes | References | Skips |
|-------------|---------------|-------|------------|-------|
| High-frequency AI blogger | 5 articles | 0-1 | 4-5 | 0 |
| Mixed batch (general blog roundup) | 19 articles | 1 | 8 | 10 |
| AI-specialized batch | 10 articles | 2-3 | 3-4 | 3-4 |

The high reference/skip ratio is a sign of **good wiki coverage health** — articles are being ingested into entity pages faster than new angles emerge.
