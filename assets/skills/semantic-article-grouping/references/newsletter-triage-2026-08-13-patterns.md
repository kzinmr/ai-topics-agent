# Newsletter Triage — 2026-08-13 Patterns

Batch: 3 newsletters (AINews "SpaceXAI Grok 4.6 and Grok @Bot" / beehiiv "🤖 Elon Just Hired A Bot Into Your Company" / Interconnects "I wrote an AI textbook"). Run 20260813T102116Z.

## Publication identity: Substack handle `robotic` (pub 48206) = Interconnects AI (Nathan Lambert)
- The checkpoint `source_name` is the article title (source-name trap). The reliable publication label: **Interconnects AI** by Nathan Lambert; canonical domain `www.interconnects.ai` (the `robotic` handle is the legacy Substack slug).
- `open.substack.com/pub/robotic/p/{slug}` resolves with JSON-LD author "Nathan Lambert", `isAccessibleForFree: true`, full `<article>` body (36 paragraphs).
- Entity `entities/nathan-lambert.md` is a rich page (287+ lines) that may already carry book-shipping news but miss reflective essays — read content sections before skipping; enrichment is a valid take.
- Cross-link: `rlhfbook.com` (RLHF textbook), `\\editor{}` Claude Code workflow detail, GPT 5.5 Pro typo-finding vs Claude-as-editor claims.

## AINews canonical fetch (re-confirmed)
- `open.substack.com/pub/swyx/p/{slug}` returns the ~1.3KB redirect stub whose `<title>` IS `https://www.latent.space/p/{slug}?triedRedirect=true` → re-fetch `www.latent.space/p/{slug}` for the full body.
- JSON-LD `isAccessibleForFree: false` but `<article>` extraction yields 48 substantive paragraphs — false-paywall pattern, treat as effectively free (AINews daily bulletin is normally free).

## Thin inbox summary + beehiiv 403 → subject-line-only skip
- beehiiv uid=498 ("🤖 Elon Just Hired A Bot Into Your Company"): all 20 `v2/c/` links returned HTTP 403 with 0 redirects (test Link 1 → batch verdict; links ~17h old).
- Inbox summary classified medium-high but identified NO publication and gave NO `link_resolution`/`articles` breakdown — subject-level guess only ("enterprise AI agents / xAI").
- Action: subject-line-only assessment; topic already covered by the AINews Grok Bot take + `concepts/multi-agents/agent-team-swarm.md` → batch skip, no take forced (body unreachable).
- Lesson: "inbox as PRIMARY source" applies when the summary has substance; a thin summary degrades to the subject-line-only sub-case.

## Cross-pipeline dedup with blog-triage
- Blog-triage JSON (`~/.hermes/cron/data/blog_ingest/triage_latest.json`, 2026-08-13T10:30Z) already took DeepSeek V4 Pro 0813 → `concepts/deepseek-v4.md`; AINews DeepSeek V4 Pro GA mention skipped as duplicate (price $0.435/M also matches `entities/deepseek.md`).
- MAI-Thinking-1 recap skipped: fully covered by `concepts/microsoft-mai-models.md` + `entities/mai-thinking-1.md`.

## Python syntax pitfall: embedded double quotes in `reason_ja`
- Building the triage script with Japanese reason strings containing English quotes (`"built from scratch"`) inside double-quoted Python strings → SyntaxError caught at write_file lint (line 108).
- Fix: use single quotes inside the Japanese string, or escape. write_file's lint catches it before terminal run — re-read the offending line and patch, don't rewrite the whole file.

## Decisions produced (8: 2 takes / 2 refs / 4 skips)
- take: Grok 4.6 + Grok Bot → `events/grok-4-6-launch.md` + `entities/xai.md` (model family table stops at 4.5; Grok Bot = AI teammate category entrant, AA Intelligence Index 61, AA-Briefcase gains)
- take: Nathan Lambert essay → `entities/nathan-lambert.md` enrichment (models stagnant in long-form non-fiction; <1% AI sentences in book; 2-5yr human-crafted prediction)
- reference: Qwen3.8-Max 95B active MoE → `concepts/qwen-3-8.md` (page lists active params as open question; bulletin answers 2.4T total / 95B active + Yuchen Jin day-0 serving quote)
- reference: Claude text watermark rollout (Aug 2, 2026) → `concepts/synthid.md` (page lacks production rollout; Reddit recap has keyed sampling bias + Nature "Scalable watermarking" refs)
- skip ×4: DeepSeek V4 Pro GA (blog-triage took), MAI-Thinking-1 (covered), beehiiv batch (403), AINews minor mentions (LTX-2.5, Cohere North Micro Vision, SL2T, vLLM, Solar Pro 4, DiG-bench — Agent Plugins 1.0 already in `concepts/agent-plugins-1-0-0.md`)
