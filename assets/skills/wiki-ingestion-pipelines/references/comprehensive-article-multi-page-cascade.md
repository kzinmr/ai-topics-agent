# Comprehensive Article Multi-Page Enrichment Cascade

When a single comprehensive article (typically a "hack list", "state of", or ecosystem survey by a known author) touches multiple wiki pages, enrich them in a specific cascade order rather than creating new pages or dumping all content into one concept page.

## Detection Signals

- Article by an author who **already has an entity page** in the wiki
- Article is an **update/sequel** to a previously-ingested article ("Every X Hack I Know, June 2026" ← "Every Claude Code Hack I Know, March 2026")
- Article covers: personal workflow evolution + tools + methodology + company ecosystem + failure modes
- Multiple existing wiki pages already cover different facets of the article's content

## Cascade Order (Priority)

| Priority | Page Type | What Goes Here | Example from Session |
|----------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Author entity** | Complete workflow evolution, new tools created, updated OSS stats, new key theses, timeline entries | `matt-van-horn.md`: March→June timeline, last30days 27K stars, AgentMail OSS, Human Signal thesis |
| 2 | **Primary concept** | New section with named patterns from the article, add author to practitioners list, add new tools to tools list | `agentic-engineering.md`: Section 12 "Van Horn's Stack" with 8 sub-patterns |
| 3 | **Methodology concept** | Internals/mechanics the article reveals about a specific technique, contributor ecosystem | `compound-engineering-every.md`: /ce-plan internals, "Plan for the Plan" pattern |
| 4 | **Organization entity** | Updated ecosystem stats, new tool mentions, contributor relationships | `every-inc.md`: Plugin stats, Van Horn's CE-inspired projects |
| 5 | **Anti-pattern / risk page** | Failure modes, addiction risks, social impacts the article warns about | `anti-patterns-in-agentic-engineering.md`: AI Psychosis section (was a stub) |

## Why This Order

1. **Entity first** — The author page anchors everything. Subsequent pages wikilink back to it.
2. **Concept second** — The practice/theory page connects the dots between tools and philosophy.
3. **Methodology third** — The specific technique gets its internals documented with the entity page as primary source citation.
4. **Organization fourth** — The company behind the tools gets ecosystem credit.
5. **Anti-patterns last** — Risk/failure content is easier to write once the positive patterns are documented.

## Execution Pattern (Cron-Safe)

Since `execute_code` is blocked in cron mode, and `patch` frequently fails on files with Unicode (smart quotes, em-dashes), use this pattern for complex multi-line insertions:

```bash
# 1. Write Python to /tmp/
write_file /tmp/patch_PAGENAME.py

# 2. Run it
terminal python3 /tmp/patch_PAGENAME.py

# 3. Verify
read_file (check the patched section)
```

The Python script pattern:
```python
import os
with open(os.path.expanduser('~/wiki/PATH/to/file.md'), 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Find insertion point by content match (not line number)
for i, line in enumerate(lines):
    if 'UNIQUE_ANCHOR_TEXT' in line:
        insert_idx = i
        break

# Insert content
lines.insert(insert_idx, NEW_CONTENT + '\n')

with open(os.path.expanduser('~/wiki/PATH/to/file.md'), 'w') as f:
    f.writelines(lines)
```

This avoids ALL the patch tool's failure modes: escape-drift on Unicode, partial-match corruption, embedded line-number corruption, pipe prefix artifacts.

## Git Commit Pattern

After enriching multiple pages, selectively stage only the touched files to avoid pulling in unrelated changes from sibling cron jobs:

```bash
git add wiki/concepts/PAGE1.md wiki/entities/PAGE2.md wiki/log.md wiki/raw/articles/NEW_RAW.md
git commit -m 'wiki: X bookmarks ingest — <summary>'
```

If the pre-commit hook blocks with "Tag Taxonomy Violations", add the missing tag to SCHEMA.md before re-committing. Do NOT use `--no-verify`.

## Multi-Source Same-Author Distinction

This cascade pattern is for **one article enriching multiple pages simultaneously**. The "Multi-Source Same-Author Sequential Enrichment" pattern (in `wiki-entity-enrichment-from-article`) applies when you get **multiple separate articles over time** from the same author. Both patterns are valid and complementary.
