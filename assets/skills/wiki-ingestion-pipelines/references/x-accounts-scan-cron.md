# x-accounts-scan cron: agent-side procedure

Procedure the agent runs AFTER `fetch_x_accounts.py` emits its JSON
(cron job `x-accounts-scan`, ~22:30 UTC every 2 days). The script only fetches,
dedups and attaches link metadata; wiki ingestion is the agent's job.

## Steps

1. Read the summary JSON injected into the cron prompt (`new_posts[]`, handles,
   `external_urls`, link titles/descriptions, `referenced_tweet_types`).
2. Triage each post:
   - Substantial product/release/announcement content → create/update a wiki page.
   - Person-event mentions → patch the person's existing entity page.
   - Thin factual replies where the link target is an OFFICIAL PRODUCT-DOC page
     (e.g. `support.claude.com/en/articles/...` help-center FAQ) that's
     wiki-relevant but below article quality → instead of a full raw article in
     `raw/articles/`, save a condensed raw note under `wiki/raw/x-notes/`
     (e.g. `raw/x-notes/2026-09-25_bcherny_team-plan-2-seat-minimum.md`): date,
     tweet URL, author, verbatim text, link URL + status, the link-card
     `description` from tweet entities (often the full doc summary), and one line
     of context. Then append a dated section to the relevant product entity page
     citing `[[raw/x-notes/<file>]]`. No new wiki pages, index.md untouched.
     (Verified 2026-09-25: bcherny "Team has a 2-seat minimum" reply.)
   - Off-topic replies, thin link-dumps, legacy-doc references → skip, log the skip.
3. Before ANY ingestion, fetch full tweet context via xurl direct-ID lookup
   (see "Context retrieval" below) — the script's snippet is truncated.
4. Prefer updating existing entity pages (`grep` the entities/ dir for the person
   or org) over creating new pages. Create new event/concept pages only when the
   topic is central to the source.
5. Update `wiki/index.md` (correct section) + append `wiki/log.md` in the same
   commit. Commit: `cd ~/ai-topics && git add wiki/ && git commit -m
   "wiki: x-accounts-scan — <summary>" && git pull --rebase && git push`.
6. Final response is the Japanese Discord report: per-post sections, wiki actions
   taken, sources with links, and explicit skips.

## Context retrieval (xurl)

- Conversation search for older tweets returns `result_count: 0` on the free
  tier — skip it, go straight to direct-ID lookup:
  `xurl --auth oauth2 "/2/tweets/<ID>?tweet.fields=note_tweet,created_at,public_metrics,referenced_tweets,in_reply_to_user_id,entities"`
- Follow `referenced_tweets[].id` upstream (replied_to / quoted) to find the root
  announcement — the scan output often contains only a follow-up reply whose real
  payload lives one or two tweets up (e.g. @teknium's "50% context reduced" reply
  pointed to the actual Hermes Agent v0.21.0 announcement tweet, itself quoting
  the @NousResearch release tweet).
- Do NOT pass `tweet.mode=extended` — invalid parameter, request rejected.
- `entities.urls[].description` in the lookup response already carries the release
  notes / article summary, often enough without scraping the URL.

## Report-quality pitfalls

- The script summary can report `source_posts: 0` while `new_posts[]` still
  contains linked posts — trust `new_posts[]` in the detail JSON over aggregate
  counters; verify via xurl before claiming "no links".
- `referenced_tweet_types: ["replied_to"]` means the post is a reply — its
  standalone text may be meaningless without the parent. Always fetch the parent.

## Skill file lives in the repo, not ~/.hermes/skills

- `skill_manage(action="patch")` with `file_path=references/...` works ONLY when
  the `name` parameter is also passed explicitly (omitting name → "Skill '' not
  found"). This skill is authored in-repo at
  `~/ai-topics/config/hermes/skills/_custom/wiki-ingestion-pipelines/`
  (registered for skill_view, absent from `~/.hermes/skills/`). If skill_manage
  still rejects the skill name, use the `patch` tool on the repo path directly,
  then `git add config/hermes/skills/... && git commit && git push` like any
  other repo change. Same for `_overrides/` skills.

## Confirm-before-create for topics other cranes already ingested

- Before creating a page for a tweet's article, `grep -rn "<article-url-or-slug>"
  wiki/` — blog-ingest/hot-post cranes often ingested the same URL earlier under
  a different page name (e.g. hyperbo.la/w/agent-platform/ already had a full
  concept page + Lopopolo entity entry before the 2026-09-09 scan; the earlier
  session had already done most of this run's ingestion, which only became
  visible by grepping before writing). If detailed content exists, skip
  creation, cross-link only, and say so in the report.
- When resuming after a context compaction, re-verify state with grep/`git show
  --stat` before redoing work — commit messages and stat output tell you exactly
  what's already ingested.

## Index/log bookkeeping is the agent's job, not the fetch script's

- New concept/event pages must be added to `wiki/index.md` under the right
  section by hand — the fetch scripts do not touch index for concept/event
  pages. Check with `grep -n "<new-page-slug>" wiki/index.md` before committing;
  an absent page is an orphan the watchdog flags later. Bump the section count
  (e.g. `## Events (31 pages)` → 32).
- Append a `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | x-accounts-scan: ...` entry to `wiki/log.md`
  (directly after the header block, before older same-day entries). A commit
  with index/log pushes cleanly even when `git pull --rebase` refuses due to
  sibling jobs' unstaged changes elsewhere in the repo — don't fight the rebase,
  just `git push origin HEAD:main`.

## Tag taxonomy gotcha

- The pre-commit tag validator blocks non-taxonomy tags (e.g. `release` is NOT in
  SCHEMA.md; `product-release` isn't either). Safe event-page tags seen passing:
  `announcement`, org tags (`nous-research`), product tags (`hermes-agent`),
  topic tags (`context-compression`, `agent-communication`). When in doubt, drop
  the doubtful tag — `type: event` already conveys the class. Fix the tag; do not
  use `--no-verify`.
- Another blocked tag seen on 2026-09-09: `training-data` is NOT in SCHEMA.md —
  for data-rights/ToS data-usage stories use `datasets` (or `ai-ethics`) instead.
- Updating `updated:` in an existing page's frontmatter via `patch`: match the
  WHOLE line (`updated: 2026-08-31`), never a partial substring like
  `updated: 2026-08` — the replace swaps only the matched fragment and yields a
  corrupted date like `2026-09-25-31`. A second patch on the corrupted string
  fixes it; the pre-commit hook does NOT catch malformed dates.
- The tag validator runs as a pre-commit HOOK that aborts the whole `git commit`,
  so a chained `git add && git commit && git push` silently pushes nothing even
  though the shell prints later commands' output. After any first commit of a
  session, verify `git log --oneline -1` shows YOUR message before trusting push.

## Sibling-edit warning

- index.md / log.md are often touched concurrently by other cron jobs
  (hot-posts, health-fix, skeleton-enrich). Patch with minimal anchored
  old_string. Stage ONLY `wiki/` (never `git add -A`) — other jobs leave
  unrelated dirty state (jobs.json, skills) in the repo working tree, and
  `git pull --rebase` fails on unstaged changes; the commit itself still pushes.
- The push output may show sibling cron commits riding along (e.g. newsletter raw
  files). Fine as long as your own pages appear in `git show --stat HEAD` —
  verify before reporting success.

## execute_code is blocked in cron mode

- `execute_code` is REJECTED in cron sessions ("runs arbitrary local Python ...
  without user approval") unless `approvals.cron_mode: approve` is set. Do all
  edits with direct `patch` / `write_file` tool calls, one edit per call —
  batching patches through execute_code is not available here.
- `sed ... | python3` triggers the HIGH pipe-to-interpreter security scan, which
  also needs approval you cannot grant in cron. Read saved files with
  `python3 -c "print(open(...).read())"` instead of piping shell output into it.

## Scraping without a web tool (cron mode)

- This profile has NO `web_extract` tool — skills/prompts that name it are wrong for this agent. Scrape via `curl -sL -A "<Chrome UA>" … -o /tmp/x.html` in `terminal`, then process the HTML with `python3 -c` (regex tag-strip + `html.unescape`). Do NOT burn a turn calling a non-existent tool.

## Scraping GitHub repo READMEs (for GitHub-link posts)

- GitHub renders the README server-side inside `<article>…</article>`. Recipe that worked for `0xsero/local-ai-registry` (2026-09-13): `curl -sL -A "<desktop Chrome UA>" <repo-url> -o /tmp/r.html`, then a `python3 -c` script that grabs `<meta name="description">` (repo one-liner) and regex-extracts the `<article>` block, tag-strips with `re.sub(r'<[^>]+>',' ',…)`, `html.unescape`, collapse whitespace. Gives enough to write a substantive raw article without cloning. Slice by char offset for long READMEs.
- Plugin-marketplace / SPA pages (e.g. `plugins.omarchy.org/plugin.html?id=…`) render client-side — curl returns "Plugin not found / Loading…". Don't treat that as a 404; the tweet text + GitHub repo carry the real content. Log such links, scrape the underlying repo instead.

## Re-amplification posts (same URL re-shared by the author)

- When `new_posts[]` links an article the wiki already documents (verify: `grep -rn "<slug>" wiki/`), do NOT re-ingest or make a new raw/page. Append a short dated "Re-amplification (YYYY-MM-DD)" note to the existing entity section quoting the tweet's framing, bump `updated:`, and log it. Example: Lambert re-shared "6 months to live for open models" (already a July section) with "a very real political threat" — one paragraph added, no duplicate page.

## Scraping Hugging Face blog pages

- HF blog articles live inside `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">` JSON. Recipe:
  `curl -sL https://huggingface.co/blog/<org>/<slug> -o /tmp/page.html`, then a
  `python3 -c` script that json.loads the __NEXT_DATA__ blob and digs for the
  long `content`/`markdown` string (regex tag-strip as fallback). This recovered
  the full NeoMME post (architecture, ViDoRe tables, compression numbers) in one
  fetch — no browser tool needed.

## Thread folding

- Several tweets from one thread promoting a single announcement (e.g. Tomaarsen's
  3-post NeoMME thread sharing the same 2 URLs) fold into ONE event page, not
  three. Dedupe candidates by shared `external_urls` before creating pages.
