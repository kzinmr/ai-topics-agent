# Wiki Ingestion Pipelines (umbrella)

This umbrella skill covers all automated wiki ingestion pipelines — from external source to wiki page. Each section below covers one pipeline end-to-end, including cron configuration, checkpoint handling, and failure recovery.

All pipelines follow the same pattern:
```
fetch external content → checkpoint → triage → wiki-ingest (create/update pages) → commit
```

> 📖 X-scan: `references/x-accounts-scan-cron.md`. Cron-mode: `references/cron-mode-constraints.md`.
> 📖 The newsletter wiki-ingest execution details (triage parse-failure recovery, take body-fetch patterns, enrichment + archive + commit/push specifics) live in `references/newsletter-wiki-ingest.md` (with `references/newsletter-take-body-fetch-pattern.md` and `references/newsletter-triage-recovery-2026-08-20.md` as supporting references). The standalone `newsletter-wiki-ingest` skill was consolidated into this umbrella on 2026-08-21.

## Section A: Newsletter Pipeline (newsletter-wiki-ingest)

> 📖 For URL resolution patterns (Substack, beehiiv, Cloudflare blocks) and classification heuristics, see `references/newsletter-triage-url-resolution.md`

Consume a pre-triaged checkpoint JSON from the newsletter-triage cron job and create/update wiki pages autonomously.

### Pipeline Chain
```
newsletter-ingest (07:10 UTC) → newsletter-triage (07:20 UTC) → newsletter-wiki-ingest (07:40 UTC)
```

### Input Format
Triage checkpoint JSON is injected via `context_from` cron chaining, or available at:
- `${HERMES_HOME}/cron/data/newsletter/triage_latest.json`
> ⚠️ Recovery: `references/newsletter-triage-checkpoint-recovery.md` + `references/git-push-concurrent-pipeline-pitfall.md`.

### Workflow
1. **Orient** on wiki: read SCHEMA.md, index.md, recent log.md
2. **Load the checkpoint** — filter to `recommended_action === "take"` decisions
3. **Detect prior batch** — scan log.md for same source/newsletter title
4. **Process each take decision**:
   - ★★★★★ → New concept page
   - ★★★★☆ → Update existing page
   - ★★★☆☆ → Entity page update
   - **⚠️ Independently verify mid-star ratings**: A triage agent may rate ★★★☆☆ (Reference) content that genuinely fills a wiki gap and should be ★★★★☆ (Take). Before accepting Reference decisions, check whether the article body contains content not present in any existing entity/concept page. If it does, upgrade to Take. Key signals: (a) the page exists but lacks the article's specific methodology/claim/data, (b) the article introduces a novel conceptual angle not covered by any existing page, (c) the article is paywalled/truncated but the free preview reveals substantive technical claims.
5. **Check reference items for triage-recommended enrichment** — Before falling through to [SILENT], scan the decisions array for reference items whose reason_ja explicitly recommends enrichment (signals: timeline update, minor reference addition). These are actionable even at the reference level. Execute the recommended minor enrichment (1-5 line addition).

6. **Create new pages first** (write_file), then update existing (patch), then index.md and log.md

7. **Commit and push**: `cd ~/ai-topics && git add wiki/ && git commit -m "wiki: newsletter ingest ..." && git push`

8. If no take decisions AND no triage-recommended reference enrichments were executed, respond [SILENT]

### Log.md prepend pitfall — header displacement

When writing a log entry to `log.md` in the newsletter-wiki-ingest step, use `new_entry + old` prepend. **But the log.md starts with a multi-line header** (`# Wiki Log\n\n_Log of all wiki changes...`) that MUST stay at the top. The naive approach:

```python
with open(LOG_PATH) as f: old = f.read()
with open(LOG_PATH, 'w') as f: f.write(new_entry + old)
```

**pushes the header down** — the new entry appears before the title. Always verify that the header is at line 1 after writing. If displaced, use the validated **strip-all-variants rebuild + 3-invariant assertion** in `references/log-prepend-header-repair.md` — the old inline re-order snippet is fragile (duplicate `# Wiki Log` headers on spacing mismatch; drops just-prepended entry when a prior pipeline already displaced the header). Never chain two mutating log scripts — one script, assert header@line1 + exactly-1-header + entry-present. Reusable script: `scripts/prepend-log-entry.py` handles this correctly (may be absent on disk — then use the reference pattern above).

### Parallel enrichment via delegate_task (Batch Pattern)

When the newsletter-wiki-ingest step has 8+ takes (creates + enrichments), parallelize using `delegate_task` with the `tasks` array:

1. **Batch 1**: Create 3 new pages concurrently (full-page writes — independent)
2. **Batch 2**: Enrich 3 existing pages concurrently (use `patch`, not `write_file`)
3. **Batch 3**: Enrich remaining 2 + references (3 tasks max per batch)

Each subagent must get explicit context with the article body, current page content, and the instruction to use `patch` not `write_file` for existing pages >40 lines. This pattern completes ~8 enrichment operations in ~70 seconds wall-clock time.

### Failure Recovery

**Case A: Checkpoint missing entirely** (no file at `triage_latest.json`).
Read the triage failure output file — it contains the embedded newsletter-ingest checkpoint with `candidates` array. Parse candidates, resolve URLs, assign star ratings, process.

**Case B: Checkpoint file `ok: false`** (file exists but ingest failed).
Read the triage failure output file for the embedded `candidates` array. Follow the same recovery path as Case A.

**Case C: Checkpoint EXISTS with valid data, but cron output parse failed** (most insidious — the triage agent saved JSON correctly to `triage_latest.json` but its final response was wrapped in markdown by the cron runner, causing downstream JSON extraction to fail).

**⚠️ Case C0 — Stale `triage_latest.json` (newsletter variant)**: The file exists and has a valid `decisions` array, but it's from YESTERDAY'S batch. The newsletter-triage agent processed the previous day's checkpoint (e.g., `checkpoint_run_id: 20260617T...`) while today's newsletters sit untriaged in `latest.json`.

**Detection**: Always check `checkpoint_run_id` in the triage JSON against today's ingest `run_id`:
```python
import os
import json
triage = json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('~/.hermes/cron/data/newsletter/triage_latest.json')))
ingest = json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('~/.hermes/cron/data/newsletter/latest.json')))
# If checkpoint_run_id is yesterday's date, the triage is stale
if triage.get("checkpoint_run_id", "").startswith("20260617"):  # yesterday
    print("STALE TRIAGE — must re-triage from today's latest.json")
```

**Recovery (Case C0 — stale checkpoint)**: Perform combined triage+wiki-ingest inline:
1. Read `triage_latest.json` — note its stale timestamp. Do NOT use its decisions.
2. Read `latest.json` (today's ingest) — extract the newsletter candidates
3. Resolve newsletter post URLs (Substack open.substack.com, beehiiv tracking links) via `web_extract` or `curl` + `<article>` extraction
4. Perform triage independently: assess AI relevance, check existing wiki coverage, assign star ratings
5. Save the new triage JSON to `triage_latest.json` (overwriting the stale data)
6. Process takes: create entity/concept pages, enrich existing pages
7. Update index.md, log.md, archive skip/reference items
8. Commit and push: `cd ~/ai-topics && git add wiki/ && git commit -m 'wiki: newsletter ingest ...' && git push`

**Concrete example (June 18, 2026)**: Newsletter-triage processed yesterday's 6 historical newsletters (Takes=0) while today's 4 newsletters were untriaged. Newsletter-wiki-ingest detected stale `checkpoint_run_id: 20260617T071109Z`, independently resolved all 4 URLs, found 2 takes (Midjourney Medical → `entities/midjourney.md`, Radical AI → `entities/radical-ai.md`) and 1 reference (State of blog → `entities/nathan-lambert.md` enrichment). Archive: 2 items, total 872 URLs. See `references/newsletter-wiki-ingest-session-2026-06-18.md`.

**Case C1 — Triage committed wiki changes inline**: commit message ≠ proof of page edits — run `git show --stat <commit>`; archive-only commit → proceed as Case C (archive already committed, skip archive_triage.py). See `references/newsletter-wiki-ingest-2026-08-04-archive-only-commit.md` (validated 2026-08-04).

**Combined triage+wiki-ingest pattern (same as blog pipeline)**: The newsletter-triage agent may perform wiki-ingest inline — creating/updating/committing entity and concept pages in the same session. When the downstream `newsletter-wiki-ingest` job (07:40 UTC) recovers from a Case C checkpoint, check git log first:
```
git log --oneline -3
```
If the triage agent already committed wiki changes (same-day commit matching the batch), skip wiki page creation and add only a log.md recovery note. The archive step will run as dedup.

1. **First check**: Read `triage_latest.json` at `${HERMES_HOME}/cron/data/newsletter/triage_latest.json`. If it contains a valid `decisions` array, the triage WORKED — use it directly. No need to re-scrape newsletter URLs.
2. **Independent verification**: The triage agent may have under-rated content (e.g., Reference for genuinely novel content that should be Take). Independently read the newsletter post body or existing wiki pages to confirm rating accuracy before accepting Reference/Skip decisions.
3. **Upgrade if warranted**: If independent verification shows the content fills a genuine wiki gap, upgrade the decision from Reference to Take and proceed with wiki ingestion.
   - **Nuance — reference enrichment without upgrading**: Even when a reference (★★★☆☆) does not warrant full ★★★★☆ upgrade, it may still justify a minor enrichment (1-5 line addition to an existing page). This applies when the triage notes "fable-5.mdへの軽微な参照追記（1-2行）に値する" — the triage explicitly recommends the addition but rates it ★★★☆☆ because the content is a perspective framing or supplementary detail, not a new fact. In this case, execute the minor enrichment without changing the star rating. The triage was correct; you're just following its recommendation.
   - **Concrete signal**: If the triage's `reason_ja` says "軽微な参照追記" (minor reference addition) or "1-2行" (1-2 lines), it's a clear recommendation to enrich despite the ★★★☆☆ rating. See `references/newsletter-wiki-ingest-session-2026-06-13.md` for the validated session.
4. **Log differently**: Use `newsletter-triage output parse failed but checkpoint valid; wiki-ingest verified and processed independently`. If 0 takes but references were enriched, log each enrichment separately.

> **Why Case C matters**: The triage agent's cron output is always wrapped in markdown by the scheduler. A downstream JSON parser that reads the `.md` output file will fail, but the triage_latest.json saved via `execute_code` or `write_file`/`terminal` dance is clean. Always check the checkpoint file before assuming the triage failed.

See `references/newsletter-wiki-ingest.md` for full Substack URL resolution patterns and State A/B/C handling.

### Case C Differentiators (Newsletter Pipeline)

| Scenario | `triage_latest.json` | Decision |
|----------|---------------------|----------|
| Case A | Missing entirely | Re-ingest from scratch |
| Case B | File exists but `ok: false` | Re-ingest from embedded candidates |
| Case C | Exists, today's date, cron parse failed | Use decisions, independent verification |
| **Case C0** | **Exists but stale (yesterday's data)** | **Must re-triage from today's latest.json** |
| Case C1 | Exists, today's date, agent committed inline | Skip wiki work, add log recovery note |

### Key Pitfalls
- **⚠️ Case C0 is the most insidious** — `triage_latest.json` looks valid (Takes=0, valid JSON) but is from yesterday. Always check `checkpoint_run_id` against today's date.
- **Inline triage is expensive but necessary** for Case C0. You must resolve newsletter URLs and assess content independently. Use `delegate_task` batch mode for parallel URL resolution (max 3 concurrent).
- Detect follow-up batches before creating pages
- Subagents need explicit absolute paths (`~/wiki/...`)
- Japanese output is mandatory for cron reports; see `references/cron-terminal-gotchas.md`
- Commit early for large batches to prevent data loss from tool call limits
- **blog-triage JSON is from yesterday at newsletter-triage time**: Newsletter-triage runs at 07:20 UTC, but blog-triage runs at 07:30 UTC. When checking `${HERMES_HOME}/cron/data/blog_ingest/triage_latest.json` for cross-pipeline dedup, that file is still from the previous day. For same-day dedup, check `raw/articles/` (sitemap-monitor at 06:00) and `log.md` instead. See `semantic-article-grouping` skill for full race condition documentation.

See `references/newsletter-wiki-ingest.md` for full workflow details.

## Section B: Active Knowledge Crawl (active-knowledge-crawl)

Daily cron job that proactively researches and ingests new concepts based on `config/hot-topics.yaml`.

### Trigger
Scheduled cron job, or manual invocation by user.

### Workflow
1. **Select Topics**: Read hot-topics.yaml, extract topics with stale `last_crawled` (>3 days)
2. **Gap Discovery** (optional when few stale topics): Survey major AI domains not in hot-topics.yaml
3. **Research**: For each topic, crawl prerequisites, laterals, or deep-dives
4. **Create Wiki Pages**: Web search → save raw source → create concept page → update index/log
5. **Update hot-topics.yaml**: Set `last_crawled: YYYY-MM-DD`
6. **Commit**: `cd ~/ai-topics && git pull --rebase && git add wiki/ config/hot-topics.yaml && git commit && git push`

### Constraints
- Max 2 concepts per topic, max 6 total per run
- Source file in raw/articles/ REQUIRED before creating concept page
- Depth-1 only (grandchildren out of scope)
- arXiv-only (not peer-reviewed) papers FORBIDDEN as sources
- Git push may fail in cron — report status clearly

### Critical Lessons
- Files may already be committed (duplicate run detection): check `git ls-files` first
- Verify files exist after `delegate_task`: explicit file existence check
- **`git pull --rebase` fails with unstaged changes from sibling processes**: If your commit already succeeded but `git pull --rebase` fails because other agents' modifications remain unstaged:
  1. Check if there's actual remote divergence: `git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main` — if empty, there is none
  2. If no divergence, **skip the `--rebase` and `git push` directly** — the commit is already clean and can be pushed as-is
  3. If there IS divergence, use `git stash && pull --rebase && stash pop` (don't rebase on top of unstaged changes)
- YAML via str.replace fragil — use sed with line numbers for hot-topics.yaml updates
- Avoid `git add -A` when sibling agents write to same repo — use selective `git add`

---

## Section C: OpenAI Blog Ingestion (openai-blog-article-ingestion)

Simple workflow for ingesting openai.com/blog articles.

### Workflow
1. **Scrape & Save**: `web_extract(url)` → save to `wiki/raw/articles/{date}-{slug}.md`
2. **Check existing pages** → patch existing concept/entity or create new
3. **Update index.md and log.md**
4. **Commit**: `cd ~/ai-topics && git add wiki/ && git commit -m "wiki: ingest OpenAI blog article - {topic}" && git push`

### Pitfalls
- OpenAI blog URLs may have `/index/` path prefix
- **openai.com returns 403 without User-Agent header**: `curl` bare requests get blocked by Cloudflare. Add `-A "Mozilla/5.0..."` header. See `references/site-specific-fetchability.md` → openai.com section for the exact command.
- Don't create duplicate pages
- Create minimal stub entity pages for newly mentioned people/organizations

---

## Section D: arXiv Paper Pipeline (arxiv-paper-pipeline)

Workflow for pulling arXiv papers, triaging by peer-review status, and ingesting into wiki.

### Save Path
Always save to `~/wiki/raw/papers/` (NOT `~/wiki/raw/articles/`).
Naming: `{YYYY-MM-DD}_{arxiv_id}_{short-title}.md`

### Triage Decision Matrix
| Paper Type | Action |
|---|---|
| Peer-reviewed conf/journal (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, CVPR, JMLR, TACL, Nature, Science) | ✅ Wiki-ingest OK |
| Tech company/industry research lab tech report (OpenAI, Meta, Google, MS, Anthropic, Huawei, Apple, Amazon, NVIDIA, and similar) | ✅ Wiki-ingest OK |
| arXiv-only (no venue) | ❌ BLOCK |
| User explicitly requests blocked paper | ✅ User override — ingest with blocked_reason note |

### Peer-Review Detection
1. Check abstract page for "Published in", "Accepted to"
2. Search Semantic Scholar for `publicationVenue`
3. If no venue found → mark as blocked

### Processing Steps
1. Search arXiv API or Semantic Scholar
2. For each candidate: fetch metadata → research peer-review → apply triage → save or block
3. If accepted: save to papers/ → create/update wiki page
4. Integrate user-provided context (tweets, discussions) alongside paper content

### Name Collision Handling (RLM and similar proliferating frameworks)

When a paper's framework name collides with an existing concept page (e.g., Huawei's lambda-RLM vs Galanos's Lambda-RLM):

1. **Detect collision early** — `search_files` for the framework name in existing concept slugs and content before creating pages
2. **Create a new concept page with a distinct, descriptive slug** (e.g., `typed-rlm` instead of reusing the conflicting `lambda-rlm`)
3. **Add frontmatter aliases** on the new page to capture the paper's name: `aliases: [original-name, Y-Combinator X, etc.]`
4. **Add a disambiguation warning** to the EXISTING page's top — brief note with wikilink to the new page
5. **Build a comparison table** on the new page showing control model, formal proofs, empirical scope, source lineage
6. **Update the parent concept page** (e.g., `rlm-recursive-language-models`) to list both as named variants
7. **Update log.md** — explain the collision, the resolution, and the comparison

See `references/arxiv-paper-pipeline.md` for further detail on blocked paper handling and JSON format.

---

## Section D2: Non-arXiv PDF Paper Ingestion (pdf-paper-ingestion)

Ingest papers from non-arXiv sources (company CDN PDFs, whitepapers, system cards) into `wiki/raw/papers/`. Covers: PDF download → PyMuPDF text extraction → frontmatter → "Raw Papers" index section → commit.

See `references/pdf-paper-ingestion.md` for the full workflow, naming conventions, and pitfalls.

When the user asks to compare two papers or system cards, see `references/paper-comparison-workflow.md` for the end-to-end workflow (download → extract → compare → commit).

---

## Section E: Blog Pipeline Troubleshooting (blog-ingest-troubleshooting) — references/blog-triage-checkpoint-recovery.md

Debug and fix the full blog/newsletter cron pipeline chain.

### Pipeline Architecture
```
ingest ──checkpoint──▶ triage ──checkpoint──▶ wiki-ingest
```

### Checkpoint File Locations
| Pipeline | Ingest checkpoint | Triage checkpoint |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Blog | `~/.hermes/cron/data/blog_ingest/latest.json` | `~/.hermes/cron/data/blog_ingest/triage_latest.json` |
| Newsletter | `~/.hermes/cron/data/newsletter/latest.json` | `~/.hermes/cron/data/newsletter/triage_latest.json` |
| **Dreaming** | `~/.hermes/cron/data/dreaming/latest.json` | `~/.hermes/cron/data/dreaming/triage_latest.json` |

### Most Common Failure: "Checkpoint Cascade"
- Ingest script times out → checkpoint stays stale
- Triage reads old checkpoint → sees 0 articles → nothing output
- Wiki-ingest reads empty triage → `[SILENT]`

### Combined Triage+Wiki-Ingest Pattern (blog pipeline) — Two Case C Sub-Patterns

The blog-triage cron agent may either (a) perform wiki-ingest inline (committing page changes during its run), or (b) produce a clean decisions array in `triage_latest.json` for downstream processing. The downstream `blog-wiki-ingest` (07:50 UTC) must handle both.

**Case C1 — Triage committed wiki changes inline** (triage agent's prompt includes wiki-ingest steps):
- `triage_latest.json` exists with decisions
- `git log --oneline -3` shows a same-day triage commit (e.g., "wiki: blog ingest ...")
- Take decisions are already in the wiki — no page work needed for takes
- **⚠️ Check reference items for unenriched targets**: The triage agent may have processed takes but MISSED reference (★★★☆☆) enrichments. Scan the triage `decisions` for reference items that have non-empty `target_pages`. For each such item:
  1. Read the target entity page — does it already contain the article's content?
  2. If the entity page exists but lacks the article's specific contribution (only a URL in `sources` or `References`, no body summary), enrich it with a brief entry (3-5 lines)
  3. Update the page's `updated` frontmatter date and add the source path to `sources`
  4. Concrete example (June 2026): george-hotz reference for "Summoning the Demon" (Jun 17) was missed by the triage agent's inline commit despite having `target_pages: [entities/george-hotz]`. Enrichment added one notable-posts bullet line, updated `updated` date, and added the raw article source path.
- Recovery: add log.md recovery note (including reference enrichments), archive runs as dedup

**Case C2 — Triage produced decisions only, no inline commit** (this session's pattern):
- `triage_latest.json` exists with valid decisions
- `git log --oneline -3` shows NO same-day triage commit
- Take decisions need to be processed from the checkpoint
- **Reference enrichment check**: Reference items whose `reason_ja` recommends enrichment (signals: "追記推奨", "言及する価値あり", timeline update, `candidate_wiki_path` populated) are actionable even when Takes=0 — enrich via patch only (1-12 lines, update `updated`+`sources`). References CAN parallelize with takes on DIFFERENT files (validated Aug 2026); sequential only for same-file targets.
- Recovery: read `triage_latest.json`, process takes via parallel subagents (batch 3+2 for 5 takes), then reference enrichments (see Case C2 reference-check bullet re parallelization), update log.md, commit

**Common recovery procedure** for `blog-wiki-ingest` on Case C (both sub-patterns start with the same first step):
1. Verify by reading the checkpoint: confirm the decisions array is valid with recommended_action fields
2. Check `git log --oneline -3` — same-day triage commit? If yes, classify by `git show --stat <commit>`:
   - **Inline wiki edits (C1)**: commit touches entity/concept/event pages → skip wiki page creation; add only a log.md recovery note; archive runs as dedup.
   - **Archive-only (still C2)**: commit touches only `wiki/raw/archived/triage/` + `archive_index.json` (message like "archive skip/reference items (N takes flagged for wiki-ingest)") → takes are flagged but NOT processed; proceed to step 3. See `references/blog-wiki-ingest-archive-only-commit.md`.
   3. Read each take's `candidate_wiki_path` from the decisions array. The `body_excerpt` and `reason_ja` fields provide enough context for enrichment. Also scan reference items — if a reference's `reason_ja` explicitly recommends enrichment (signals: "追記推奨", "言及する価値あり", `candidate_wiki_path` populated), treat it as actionable.
   4. **Process takes via parallel subagents** in 2 batches (batch 1: 3 tasks, batch 2: remaining). Each subagent receives raw article path + existing page content + exact insertion points.
   5. **Process reference enrichments** — sequential by default, but references CAN batch in parallel with takes when targeting DIFFERENT files (validated Aug 2026: cory-doctorow take + lcamtuf reference, zero conflicts). Real constraint is file-conflict avoidance. Update frontmatter (`updated`, `sources`) per page; on "Found 2 matches" for sources, use the preceding source path as context.
   6. Update log.md with enrichment summary. Commit all changes.
   7. Archive: runs as dedup (triage agent already archived skip/reference items).

**Concrete example (June 11, 2026)**: 5 takes (simonwillison.net ×3, garymarcus, johndcook) → enriched mythos/simon-willison/gary-marcus/john-d-cook/gemma-family in 2 batches (~80s).

See `references/blog-ingest-troubleshooting.md` section "Triage cron output parse failed (but checkpoint IS valid)" for the full Case C recovery procedure.

### Re-executing a Pipeline
1. Run ingest jobs first (blog + newsletter concurrently)
2. Then triage jobs
3. Then wiki-ingest jobs

⚠️ `cronjob(run)` is async — run ingest scripts directly from terminal if cron scheduler fails:
| Pipeline | Script path |
|----------|-------------|
| Blog ingest | `python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/blog_ingest.py` |
| Newsletter ingest | `python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/process_email.py` |

### Stage-Specific Issues
**Ingest:**
- Missing `daily_inbox_collect` module → create stub module
- Wrong DB path → use `~/.blogwatcher/blogwatcher.db`
- Pre-run script timeout → parallelize with ThreadPoolExecutor, write checkpoint before scraping
- **CRITICAL: SQLite `is_read` dedup pattern** — The blogwatcher DB (`~/.blogwatcher/blogwatcher.db`) has `articles` table with `is_read` (boolean) and `discovered_date` (date) columns. If `blog_ingest.py` times out at 120s, the most likely cause is `query_todays_articles()` in `daily_inbox_collect.py` lacking a date filter, causing it to fetch ALL articles (thousands of rows) instead of just today's. The fix:
  1. Ensure SQL query includes `WHERE discovered_date >= date('now', '-1 day') AND is_read = 0`
  2. After successful scrape+save in `blog_ingest.py`, call `mark_articles_as_read()` to set `is_read = 1`
  3. This prevents duplicate processing on subsequent cron runs
  4. The `daily_inbox_collect` module lives at `~/.hermes/scripts/daily_inbox_collect.py`
  5. After fixing scripts, re-run the pipeline and `cd ~/ai-topics && git add wiki/ && git commit && git push`

**Triage:** Reads from ingest checkpoint. Empty checkpoint → no output. May also produce markdown report instead of valid JSON — downstream wiki-ingest will fail with parse error. See `references/blog-ingest-troubleshooting.md` for recovery.

**Wiki-ingest:** Reads from triage checkpoint. No take decisions → [SILENT].

### Script Dual Location
Scripts live in TWO locations that must be kept in sync:
| Location | Purpose | Git-tracked? |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Source of truth | ✅ Yes |
| `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Cron execution copy | ❌ No |

When fixing: edit ai-topics/scripts, then cp to .hermes/scripts.

## Section F: Dreaming — Knowledge Consolidation Cycle (dreaming)

Automated consolidation process analyzing recently collected articles and folding significant findings into the wiki.

### Pipeline
- **Phase 1 (pre-run script)**: `~/.hermes/scripts/dreaming.py` collects RSS scan articles, newsletters, existing wiki pages
- **Phase 2 (LLM processing)**: Analyzes, creates/updates wiki pages, commits

### Workflow
1. **Duplicate Check**: Review what adjacent scheduled jobs already completed (daily inbox update, active crawl, etc.)
2. **Light Sleep** (Screening): Review articles not already processed, group by semantic themes
3. **REM** (Flat Synthesis): Score each theme using weighted signals (relevance 0.30, frequency 0.25, query_diversity 0.15, recency 0.15, consolidation 0.10, conceptual_richness 0.05)
   - Score ≥ 0.65: Create or update wiki page
   - Score 0.45-0.65: Add to existing page or log for review
4. **NJ Delivery Filter**: Apply Newsjacking lens (0-5) to select what to deliver
   - NJ ≥ 4: Lead story; NJ = 3: Secondary; NJ ≤ 1: Omit from delivery
5. **Deep Sleep** (Replay-safe integration): Create/update wiki pages, cross-references, index/log, commit

### Sub-Patterns
- **Pattern A**: Existing coverage depth check — don't auto-update, check if page already covers the insight
- **Pattern B**: Newsletter noise filtering (Substack UI elements, redirect chains)
- **Pattern C**: Batch entity discovery — create missing entity pages for recurring people/companies
- **Pattern D**: Duplicate detection matrix (filename, index entry, content grep, session_search)

## 0-Article Recovery Workflow (Shell Commands)

When the dreaming checkpoint reports `collected_articles=0`, raw articles may still exist that other pipelines didn't consume. Use this concrete workflow:

### Step 1: Count recent raw articles
```bash
find ~/wiki/raw/articles -name "*.md" -mtime -3 -size +500c | wc -l
```

### Step 1.5: Cross-pipeline dedup check (FIRST — saves the most time)
Before scanning raw articles, check the latest blog triage JSON. This immediately rules out the entire blog-ingest batch (typically 15-20 articles already decided as skip/reference), catching ~70% of raw articles from the blog pipeline.

```bash
# Check blog triage exists
ls -la ~/.hermes/cron/data/blog_ingest/triage_latest.json
# Also check newsletter triage
ls -la ~/.hermes/cron/data/newsletter/triage_latest.json
```

Read the triage JSON with a Python script (pipe_to_interpreter blocked in cron mode — use `write_file` to `/tmp/` then `terminal python3`):
```python
import os
import json, os
blog_path = os.path.expanduser(os.path.expanduser('~/.hermes/cron/data/blog_ingest/triage_latest.json'))
with open(blog_path) as f:
    d = json.load(f)
for x in d.get("decisions", []):
    print(f"{x['recommended_action']}: {x.get('source_name','')} - {x.get('title','')[:60]}")
```

Articles already decided in blog/newsletter triage should be marked as `skip (already captured by blog pipeline)` before proceeding to full analysis. This is the single most time-saving step in the recovery workflow.

### Step 2: Find genuinely unprocessed articles
```bash
find ~/wiki/raw/articles -name "*.md" -size +500c -mtime -3 | while read f; do
  base=$(basename "$f" .md)
  count=$(grep -rl "$base" ~/wiki/entities/ ~/wiki/concepts/ ~/wiki/log.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
  if [ "$count" -eq 0 ]; then
    size=$(stat -c%s "$f")
    echo "UNPROCESSED: $base ($size bytes)"
  fi
done
```
This checks each article filename against entity pages, concept pages, AND log.md. An article is "unprocessed" only if zero references exist anywhere.

### Step 3: Filter by AI relevance
Read each unprocessed article's first 50+ lines. Skip:
- Vintage computing, math, F1, politics, general security (non-AI)
- Event announcements, marketing promos (low wiki value)
- Link blog posts already covered by another source (check krebsonsecurity, simonwillison references)

### Step 4: Check existing entity page coverage
First verify entity page exists, then check content depth:
```bash
# Quick existence check (faster than grep)
ls ~/wiki/entities/<entity>.md 2>/dev/null && echo "EXISTS" || echo "MISSING"
# Content depth check
grep -E "^##" ~/wiki/entities/<entity>.md
# Also check for article-specific keywords
grep -i "keyword-from-article" ~/wiki/entities/<entity>.md
```
If the entity page exists but lacks the article's specific content → enrichment candidate (TAKE/REFERENCE).

### 6. Build triage JSON
Since `execute_code` is blocked in cron mode, use `write_file` to `/tmp/dreaming_triage.py` then `terminal python3 /tmp/dreaming_triage.py`. Key: use `None` (Python) not `null` (JS) for optional fields.

### 7. Process takes via parallel subagents

When the triage has 3+ take decisions, process them in parallel using `delegate_task` with batch mode (up to 3 concurrent tasks):

**Batch breakdown strategy (proven pattern, 6 June 2026):**
- Batch 1: New concept pages (write_file) + 1 entity enrichment (patch) — 3 tasks
- Batch 2: Remaining entity enrichments (patch) — remaining tasks
- Each subagent receives full article content + existing page content + exact insertion points
- After batch completion, verify all files exist, then update index.md and log.md

**Pitfall: Subagent wikilink format drift.** Subagents may use non-standard wikilink formats like `[[Entity(name)]]` instead of the canonical `[[entities/name]]` or `[[concepts/name]]`. Always verify new page content after creation and fix any malformed wikilinks. Specific pitfall (June 2026): subagent created `[[Entity(elevenlabs)]]` instead of the correct format — this was caught during index.md insertion but could have gone unnoticed in log.md.

**Pitfall: Unclosed brackets.** Subagents may create wikilinks without closing the `]]` — always grep for `[[` in newly created pages and verify each one has a matching `]]`.

**Pitfall: Language policy in subagent-created pages.** Subagents may include Japanese summary sections (`## 日本語まとめ`) in concept pages even though the wiki language policy bans non-English content in pages outside `raw/`. After creating new pages, verify no Japanese characters exist before committing. Use `grep -Pn '[\x{3000}-\x{9FFF}]'` to scan for CJK characters in non-raw pages.

### Step 6: Archive skip/reference items
After saving the triage JSON, archive skip and reference decisions for later re-evaluation:
```bash
cd ~/ai-topics && python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/archive_triage.py dreaming --keep-reference
```

## Case C Recovery (Cron Output Parse Failed)

The dreaming pipeline shares the same Case C recovery pattern documented in Section A (Newsletter) and Section E (Blog). When the dreaming-group agent's cron output is wrapped in markdown by the scheduler, downstream JSON extraction fails — but `triage_latest.json` may or may not have been saved to disk correctly.

### ⚠️ Case C0 — Stale `triage_latest.json` (NEW sub-pattern)

The most insidious variant: `triage_latest.json` exists and has a valid `decisions` array, but it's from YESTERDAY. The dreaming-group agent never saved today's output to checkpoint. A quick read shows "6 decisions, Takes=0" and looks fine — but it's stale data.

**Detection**: Always check the `triage_timestamp` or `checkpoint_run_id` field in the triage JSON. If it's not today's date, the file is stale:
```python
import os
import json
d = json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('~/.hermes/cron/data/dreaming/triage_latest.json')))
ts = d.get("triage_timestamp", d.get("checkpoint_run_id", "none"))
# Check against today: "2026-06-14" should appear in the timestamp
print(f"Triage timestamp: {ts}")
```
If stale, proceed to the cron output file recovery path (Case C3 below).

**Differentiators** from other cases:
| Scenario | `triage_latest.json` | Decision |
|----------|---------------------|----------|
| Case A | Missing entirely | Re-ingest from scratch |
| Case B | File exists but `ok: false` | Re-ingest from embedded candidates |
| Case C1 | Exists, today's date, agent committed inline | Use decisions, skip wiki work, add log |
| Case C2 | Exists, today's date, agent did NOT commit | Process takes from decisions |
| **Case C0 (new)** | **Exists but stale (yesterday's data)** | **Must recover from cron output** |
| Case C3 | Missing — triage never saved anything | Recover from cron output file |

### Checkpoint Paths

| Pipeline | Ingest checkpoint | Triage checkpoint |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Dreaming | `~/.hermes/cron/data/dreaming/latest.json` | `~/.hermes/cron/data/dreaming/triage_latest.json` |

### Case C3 — Recovery from Cron Output File (when triage_latest.json is stale or missing)

When the dreaming-group agent's cron output is known to exist (from `ls` on the output directory) but `triage_latest.json` is stale or missing:

1. **Read the output file**: Typically at `~/.hermes/cron/output/<job-id>/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md`
2. **Find the embedded JSON**: The cron output file is ~3500 lines — the first ~3480 lines are the cron prompt and skill instructions. The dreaming-group agent's response starts at the `## Response` heading, followed by a ` ```json ` block near the very end of the file. **Skip to the last 100 lines**: `tail -100 ~/.hermes/cron/output/<job-id>/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md`. Search for `"checkpoint_run_id"` or `"summary_ja"` to locate the JSON.
3. **Extract the decisions** — the JSON has the same structure as a triage checkpoint: `decisions[]` array with `recommended_action`, `reason_ja`, `body_excerpt`, `candidate_wiki_path`.
4. **Check git log**: `git log --oneline -3` — look for a same-day dreaming commit. The dreaming-group agent may have committed inline even though it didn't save checkpoint. If same-day commit exists → Case C1, skip wiki work, add log recovery note.
5. **If no same-day dreaming commit**: The agent produced decisions but didn't save or commit. Save the recovered JSON to `triage_latest.json` yourself:
   - Reconstruct the full JSON with `ensure_ascii=False` (contains Japanese text)
   - Save to `~/.hermes/cron/data/dreaming/triage_latest.json`
   - Then proceed as normal: verify decisions, process takes, archive, commit

### Case C1 — Triage agent committed wiki changes inline

The dreaming-group agent's prompt includes wiki-ingest steps. When it runs, it may create/enrich/commit wiki pages during the triage session. The downstream `dreaming-wiki-ingest` (18:20 UTC) must detect this:

1. **First check**: Read `triage_latest.json` at `~/.hermes/cron/data/dreaming/triage_latest.json`. **Check its timestamp** — if it's not today's date, the file is stale (see Case C0 above). Use the cron output file recovery path (C3) instead.
2. **Check git log**: `git log --oneline -3` — look for a same-day dreaming commit (e.g., `dreaming: consolidation YYYY-MM-DD — N articles...`)
3. **Independent verification**: Verify each decision by checking the target wiki page's content depth (line count, keyword grep for article-specific claims). Do not assume skip decisions are correct — confirm that the existing page genuinely covers the article.
4. **If Case C1 (triage committed inline)**:
   - Skip wiki page creation (already done by triage agent)
   - Add a log.md recovery note recording the Case C recovery
   - Run `archive_triage.py dreaming --keep-reference` (will return dedup — all items already archived by triage agent)
   - Commit and push the recovery note
5. **If Case C2 (triage produced decisions only, no inline commit)**:
   - Follow the same `take` processing workflow as Section A (parallel subagents, enrich pages, update index/log)
   - See Section A's Case C recovery for the full workflow

**Differentiator** (C1 vs C2): The dreaming-group agent's prompt typically includes wiki-ingest steps (it's a single combined triage+ingest agent). C1 is the EXPECTED case — the triage agent almost always commits inline. C2 only occurs if the agent's prompt separates triage from ingest, or if the agent times out before committing.

### Concrete Example (June 13, 2026)

- Dreaming-group collected 6 RSS articles from 2026-06-09
- Triaged all 6 as skip (already covered by existing wiki pages: sample-efficiency.md 127 lines, siri-ai.md 149 lines, ed-zitron.md 470 lines, martin-alderson.md 232 lines, entropicthoughts-com.md 214 lines, gary-marcus.md 262 lines)
- Triaged agent committed inline: `3b2e578d dreaming: consolidation 2026-06-13 — 5/6 articles already covered, 1 entity gap filled (entropicthoughts)`
- Downstream dreaming-wiki-ingest found `triage_latest.json` valid, verified all 6 decisions independently, confirmed Case C1 via git log, added recovery note, archive was dedup
- Total time: ~2 minutes for full recovery cycle

### Concrete Example (June 14, 2026) — Case C0 + C3 Recovery

- Dreaming-group collected 6 RSS articles from 2026-06-09 via `latest.json`
- `triage_latest.json` existed but was **stale** (from June 13 — same 6 articles already triaged yesterday!) — Case C0
- No same-day dreaming commit in git log
- Cron output file at `~/.hermes/cron/output/<job-id>/2026-06-14_18-12-10.md` (3567 lines) contained the dreaming-group response starting at line 3492
- Found by `tail -100` near the end: clean JSON with `"checkpoint_run_id": "20260614T181000Z"`, Takes=0, all 6 skip
- Recovered JSON showed same articles as yesterday — already processed. Pipeline saturation
- Saved recovered JSON to `triage_latest.json`, verified skip decisions independently (all confirmed), archive returned "All items already archived (dedup)"
- Added log.md recovery note, committed
- **Key learning**: The stale `triage_latest.json` had the SAME 6 articles as the fresh `latest.json` — the ingest checkpoint (`latest.json`) overwrites with fresh data nightly, but old 2026-06-09 RSS articles persist across days until they drop off. Check the article DATE in the ingest checkpoint, not just the checkpoint file date.

## Pitfalls
- Duplicate detection is MANDATORY
- Always check existing pages first (don't trust 0.65 threshold alone)
- **Log.md corruption via patch (accidental `|` prefix)** — When using `read_file` output as `patch` input for `index.md`, the `N|` line-number prefix from `read_file` can embed into your new content. The patch tool then writes `+|- ` instead of `- `, creating `|-` pipe-prefix corruption at the start of list items. This happens because `read_file` wraps each line as `NNN|- ...` and copying that display into `patch`'s `new_string` carries the `|` forward.\n  \n  **Reinforced fix** (validated 3× in one session, June 2026): After EVERY patch on `index.md` that inserts new list items, verify the affected lines with `sed -n 'N,Mp' wiki/index.md | cat -A`. The correct format is `- [[...]]` (no leading pipe, no `+` prefix). If you see `|- ` at line start, immediately re-patch with:\n  ```\n  old_string = \"+|- \"  (the corrupted prefix)\n  new_string = \"- \"    (the correct prefix)\n  ```\n  **Root cause**: Never use `read_file` output verbatim as `patch` input for index files. The line prefix is display-only metadata. Always type the content fresh or extract it with `sed 'Np'` (without line numbers).
- Pre-run script timeout → fallback file at `~/.hermes/cron/data/dreaming/grouped_themes_latest.json`
- Stale dreaming themes (2-3 days old) may already be processed by daily pipelines
- **0-article doesn't mean nothing to do**: `collected_articles=0` means other pipelines consumed sources, but raw articles may have arrived AFTER those pipelines ran. Always run the 0-article recovery workflow.
- **Cross-pipeline dedup order matters**: Check blog triage JSON FIRST (`~/.hermes/cron/data/blog_ingest/triage_latest.json`) — it instantly rules out 70%+ of raw articles. Then check log.md, then wiki pages. Reading articles should be the LAST step, not the first.
- **`grep -rl` with `target='files'` is NOT a filename lookup**: `search_files(target='files')` searches file *content* with regex, not filenames. Use `find` + `grep -rl` for true filename-based discovery of unprocessed articles.
- **`execute_code` blocked in cron mode**: Write Python scripts to `/tmp/` via `write_file`, then run with `terminal python3 /tmp/script.py`. Do NOT use `cat file | python3` (pipe_to_interpreter blocked).
- **⚠️ `hermes_tools` NOT importable in cron-mode subprocess scripts**: When running enrichment/enumeration scripts via `write_file` + `terminal python3` in cron mode, `from hermes_tools import read_file, patch, terminal` will fail with `ModuleNotFoundError`. `hermes_tools` is only available inside `execute_code` blocks. **Fix**: Use direct agent tool calls (`patch()`, `read_file()`, `terminal()`) from the agent's own API instead of from subprocess scripts. Restrict `/tmp/` scripts to pure-Python operations (JSON manipulation, file prepend, string replacement, git commands). See `semantic-article-grouping` skill's `references/cron-mode-enrichment-execution.md` for the full pattern.
- **`-mtime` window must match**: Step 1 (count) and Step 2 (find unprocessed) must use the same `-mtime` value. Step 1 uses `-mtime -3`; Step 2 must also use `-mtime -3`, not `-mtime -1`.
- **Same-entity multi-article enrichment requires a single script**: When 2+ articles enrich the SAME entity page, do NOT use parallel subagents (they conflict on the same file). Use the single-Python-script pattern with ordered `str.replace()` calls. See `references/dreaming-single-script-enrichment.md` for the full workflow and the `|-` read_file prefix trap that causes silent failure in `str.replace()`.

## Section G: Newsletter Triage (newsletter-triage)

### URL Resolution Patterns (CRITICAL — raw files contain tracking URLs, not canonical)

**Substack newsletters:**
- Look for `open.substack.com/pub/{publication}/p/{slug}` (usually Link 7 or 9)
- Canonical form: `https://www.{publication}.com/p/{slug}` or use the open.substack URL directly with web_extract
- IGNORE: `substack.com/redirect/2/...` (resolves to app download), `substack.com/app-link/post?...` (email tracking)
- For author attribution: extract from the raw file's `substack.com/@authorname` links

**Beehiiv newsletters:**
- URLs are wrapped as `link.mail.beehiiv.com/v1/c/...`
- **Resolution via `curl` (preferred — fast, no JS needed)**: Use `curl -sS -L -o /dev/null -w "%{url_effective}" --max-time 8 -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" -H "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml" URL`. This resolves beehiiv tracking redirects to canonical URLs (e.g., `getsuperintel.site/p/...`). Without browser-like headers, bare `curl` gets blocked by Cloudflare (HTTP 403) — the headers are essential.
- **Fallback — `web_extract`**: Use `web_extract` on the tracking URL (handles JS redirect chain). Or `web_search` with subject line + date.
- **Fallback — Newsletter web version** (when Cloudflare blocks ALL tracking links): As of July 2026, Cloudflare escalated protection — even full browser headers may get `HTTP 403 + cf-mitigated: challenge`. When this happens, find the `hp.beehiiv.com/{uuid}` link in the raw email (it's the newsletter's public web version). Scrape that instead — it contains the full newsletter text with article references and author analysis. Also check for `{publication}.site/p/{slug}` URLs. Pattern:
  ```bash
  grep -oP 'https://hp\.beehiiv\.com/[a-f0-9-]+' /path/to/raw/newsletter.md
  curl -sL 'https://hp.beehiiv.com/{uuid}' -o /tmp/page.html
  # Strip HTML → extract text for triage classification
  ```
- If all links unresolvable even with headers AND no web version found, mark as `manual_review_beehiiv_links_unresolvable` in triage output

**Cron pipeline context:** The newsletter-ingest cron job saves raw digests to wiki/raw/newsletters/ — this is the source data. Each digest contains 16-20 links, most of which are tracking/redirect URLs requiring resolution.

### Classification Criteria

| Level | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Critical** | Direct AI agent/LLM relevance, comprehensive landscape updates, major product launches | Create new concept/entity pages, major enrichments |
| **High** | Specific tooling/workflow coverage, industry context with wiki actionability | Enrich existing entities, create concept pages |
| **Medium** | Weekly roundups with 1-2 relevant items | Selective entity enrichment |
| **Low** | No wiki actionability | Skip |

### Triage Output Format

Save JSON with: `triage_timestamp`, `run_id`, `newsletters[]` (each with `message_id`, `subject`, `source`, `date`, `canonical_url`, `classification`, `summary`, `wiki_relevance`, `recommended_action`), and `summary` (counts, `key_themes[]`, `recommended_wiki_updates[]`).

### Save Locations
- `~/.hermes/cron/data/triage/newsletter-triage-{timestamp}.json` (for downstream `newsletter-wiki-ingest`)
- `~/wiki/raw/inbox/newsletter-ingest/{timestamp}.json` (wiki inbox copy)

### Key Pitfalls
- Raw newsletter files in wiki/raw/newsletters/ contain ONLY tracking/redirect URLs — you MUST resolve to canonical URLs before content extraction
- The beehiiv newsletter digest is saved but the source file may not appear in the raw directory listing (it IS there, just needs reading)
- Substack redirect chains: `substack.com/redirect/...` → app download page, NOT the article. Always use `open.substack.com/pub/...` pattern
- Multiple newsletters can arrive in the same batch — classify each independently

### Enrichment Pre-Check (recommended step)
Before finalizing classification, check which `wiki_targets` pages already exist:
```bash
# For each identified target entity/concept:
search_files(pattern="entity-or-concept-name", path="~/wiki/entities", target="files")
search_files(pattern="entity-or-concept-name", path="~/wiki/concepts", target="files")
```
- If the target page exists and is rich (>50 lines), the article is an **enrichment** candidate (update existing)
- If the target page exists but is a skeleton (<20 lines), the article is a **major enrichment** candidate
- If no target page exists, the article is a **page creation** candidate
- Note existing page status in the triage output — this saves the downstream wiki-ingest agent from re-checking

See `references/newsletter-triage.md` for detailed URL resolution patterns, classification criteria, and output format.

## Section Z: Trending Topics Reporting (trending-topics)

See `research/trending-topics-reporting` skill for the end-to-end trending topics research/reporting workflow. This is NOT an ingestion pipeline — it produces a Japanese-language trending report saved to `inbox/rss-scans/` — but it runs after all morning ingestion pipelines (12:00 UTC) and uses their output as input.

### Quick Reference
```bash
# Run the trend detector
python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/trending_topics.py --days 3

# Query DB for recent AI articles
python3 -c "import sqlite3; c=sqlite3.connect('~/.blogwatcher/blogwatcher.db').execute('''SELECT b.name, a.title, a.url FROM articles a JOIN blogs b ON a.blog_id=b.id WHERE DATE(a.discovered_date)>=date('now','-2 days') AND (a.title LIKE '%AI%' OR a.title LIKE '%agent%' OR a.title LIKE '%LLM%' OR a.title LIKE '%model%') ORDER BY b.name'''); [print(f'  [{r[0]}] {r[1]}') for r in c.fetchall()]"
> Historical host repair example retired. Use `ai-topics-agent doctor` and the migration runbook.markdown
## Raw Articles — Cheat at Search Slide Series (7 pages)

- [[raw/articles/YYYY-MM-DD_author_part-1]] — Part 1 title. Brief description. Companion: [[concepts/relevant-concept]]
- [[raw/articles/YYYY-MM-DD_author_part-2]] — Part 2 title. ...
```

**Key pitfall:** Entity project pages may link to concept pages (e.g., `[[concepts/llm-search-judge]]`) instead of raw slide articles. When registering a series, update entity pages to link directly to raw articles with concept pages as secondary references.

### Detection
```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/wiki_health.py | grep -A 3 "Unprocessed Raw Articles"
```

### Mixed-Strategy Approach (< 100 unprocessed)
1. **"Already Consumed but Unlinked" check**: Search unique phrase from article in L2 pages
2. **Tier 1 (High-Value)**: Deep-read and enrich existing wiki pages
3. **Tier 2 (Bulk-Associate)**: Add filename to existing page's References section

### Association Targets
| Article Type | Best Target |
|---|---|
| Author blog | Their entity page |
| Technical concept | Relevant concept page |
| Newsletter tracking pixel | `wiki/concepts/blogwatcher.md` |
| Metadata-only artifacts | `wiki/concepts/blogwatcher.md` |

### Bulk-Associate Workflow (>100 unprocessed)
1. Domain analysis — group by domain/author
2. Keyword-to-entity mapping
3. Batch update entity pages
4. Handle remaining unmatched articles

### Pitfalls
- Substring matching quirk: filename stem must appear verbatim in L2 content
- Escape-drift on YAML frontmatter patches — use markdown References section instead

## Section I: X Bookmarks Ingest (x-bookmarks-ingest)

Cron pipeline triggered by `fetch_x_bookmarks.py` that processes incoming X/Twitter bookmarks and ingests external articles into the wiki.

### Pipeline Chain
```
fetch_x_bookmarks.py (pre-run script, every 6h) → x-bookmarks-ingest (agent cron)
```

### Input Format
The agent cron job receives a JSON payload with `new_bookmarks[]` array. Each bookmark contains:
- `id`, `author_id`, `created_at`, `text`, `public_metrics` (bookmark_count, like_count, etc.)
- `entities.urls[]` — each URL has `expanded_url`, `display_url`, `status` (HTTP), and optionally `title`/`description`
- `external_urls[]` — URLs with `status: 200` that are NOT X article links
- `article` — for X Articles (`x.com/i/article/...`), contains `title` field

### Workflow

1. **Extract actionable URLs**: Filter bookmarks for `external_urls[]` with `status: 200`. These are direct article links (OpenAI blog, Substack, arXiv, etc.). X Articles (`x.com/i/article/...`) with `status: 500` require the fallback path.

2. **Scrape external articles**: `web_extract()` each external URL. Save to `wiki/raw/articles/{YYYY-MM-DD}_{source}_{slug}.md`. The OpenAI blog and Meta/FAIR research blogs typically return full content.

3. **X Article content extraction** (in priority order):

   a. **Check `article.plain_text` FIRST** — The bookmark/tweet metadata frequently contains the FULL article body in `article.plain_text` even when the URL returns HTTP 500. If `article.plain_text` has substantial content (>2KB), save it directly as the raw article and skip all API/mirror fallbacks. Both the article body AND inline code blocks (`article.entities.code[]`) are available. See `wiki-entity-enrichment-from-article` skill's `references/x-article-plain-text-content.md` for the full pattern, decision logic table, and content preservation notes.

   b. **Identify the author** (CRITICAL — do this BEFORE scraping mirrors): X Articles don't have an `author_name` field in bookmark metadata. The `author_id` in the tweet is the bookmarker, not the article author. To find the actual author:
      - **Check `article.plain_text` for cross-post URLs**: Look for "Cross-posted from https://..." or explicit blog URLs in the article body. Curl the canonical blog URL and grep for `<meta name="author"`, `<script type="application/ld+json">`, and `<meta name="twitter:creator"` to extract author identity, affiliation, and handle. This is the MOST RELIABLE method — static HTML meta tags don't need JS rendering or API auth.
      - **Check `article.entities.mentions[]`**: The mentions array lists X handles cited in the article. The first mention may be the author or a key reference.
      - **Check `article.entities.urls[]`**: URLs in the article body often point to the canonical blog post, the author's homepage, or related resources with author metadata.
      - See `references/xurl-author-identification-x-bookmarks.md` for the full author identification workflow, including cross-post meta tag extraction, failure modes, and session patterns.

   c. **Try GetXAPI** (if `$GETXAPI_KEY` is set) — Structured JSON with headings and lists. Use the parent tweet's ID.

   c. **Mirror search** — For articles where `article.plain_text` is empty or too short:
   - Extract `article.title` from bookmark metadata
   - Run `web_search` with: `"<article title>" 2026` (add author name or domain keywords)
   - Common mirrors: LangChain blog (`blog.langchain.com/...`), Substack, arXiv, personal blogs
   - If found → scrape and save. If not → mark as metadata-only, skip wiki creation.
   - Notable authors often cross-post: check `blog.langchain.com`, `substack.com`, author's personal site.

4. **Check for existing entity pages BEFORE creating new ones**: This is the most common pitfall. Before creating any person/org entity page:
   - `search_files(pattern="firstname.*lastname|@handle", path="~/wiki/entities", target="files")`
   - Also check `search_files(target="content")` for aliases referencing the same person under different slugs (e.g., Varun Trivedy = Vivek Trivedy = @Vtrivedy10)
   - If an existing page is found (even with a slightly different slug), update THAT page — do NOT create a duplicate.

5. **Prioritize by engagement**: Process highest-bookmark-count articles first (signal of importance).

6. **Create/update wiki pages**: Follow `wiki-entity-enrichment-from-article` skill for entity/concept creation. For multi-article batches by the same author (e.g., two LangChain blog posts by Vivek Trivedy), use the Multi-Source Same-Author Sequential Enrichment pattern. For a single comprehensive article that touches many pages (entity + concept + methodology + org + anti-patterns), use the **Comprehensive Article Multi-Page Cascade** pattern — see `references/comprehensive-article-multi-page-cascade.md`.

7. **Update index.md and log.md**: One log entry summarizing the entire batch. Update index.md entry count. Patch existing concept page descriptions if significantly changed.

8. **Commit and push**: `cd ~/ai-topics && git add wiki/ && git commit -m "wiki: X bookmarks ingest — <summary>" && git push`

### Key Pitfalls

- **Duplicate entity detection is MANDATORY**: Before creating any person entity page, search for existing pages under different slugs (e.g., `vtrivedy10.md` vs `varun-trivedy.md` vs `vivek-trivedy.md`). Many tracked people already have pages created by `build_x_wiki.py`.
- **X Articles behind auth wall**: `web_extract()` on `x.com/i/article/...` returns JavaScript wall or login page. **Check `article.plain_text` first** — it often contains the full article body. Only use `web_search` for mirrors as a last resort when `article.plain_text` is insufficient or empty. See `references/x-article-plain-text-content.md` in `wiki-entity-enrichment-from-article` skill.
- **Image-only bookmarks**: Bookmarks where the only URLs are `pic.x.com/...` media links have no scrapable content. Skip them.
- **Thread-only bookmarks (trivial)**: Bookmarks with a single short tweet, no external URL, no thread, and <50 bookmarks. Skip for article scraping (save as metadata-only).
- **Truncated thread bookmarks with a substantive claim (★★☆☆☆)**: Bookmarks where X API truncation cuts the tweet text mid-sentence (leaving a fragment like "The first is a"), but the available fragment contains ONE clear, substantive claim. The full thread is unrecoverable via `xurl search "conversation_id:..."` (API returns 0 results for single-tweet conversations). **Recovery**: (1) Save the available fragment as a raw article with `status: TRUNCATED` and a note in the frontmatter. (2) Check if the fragment has a standalone claim worth enriching an existing entity page (e.g., an analyst's enterprise adoption pattern, a benchmark result, a product announcement). (3) If the claim is substantive AND the author already has an entity page, add a brief contribution entry to their Notable Contributions section with the raw article wikilink. (4) Do NOT try to chase mirrors or reconstruct the full thread — X API truncation is permanent for these tweets. Example (Jun 2026): Jaya Gupta's "OpenAI vs Anthropic enterprise" thread — fragment carried "ChatGPT as org-wide default, Claude ring-fenced for power users" before truncation. Enriched `jaya-gupta.md` with a 4-line contribution entry. Engagement metrics (139 bookmarks, 334 likes) confirmed the fragment had signal value despite truncation.
- **Rich thread-only bookmarks (★★★☆☆ to ★★★★★)**: Bookmarks where the tweet text ITSELF is substantive, with no external article URL but the thread contains detailed technical claims, benchmarks, paper/code/model links, and high engagement (>100 bookmarks). The thread IS the article. **Do NOT skip these.** Process the full thread via `xurl search "conversation_id:<id>"` to reconstruct all author tweets, save the combined thread as a raw article in `wiki/raw/articles/`, create entity pages for the author and collaborators, and create/enrich concept pages for the announced technology. See `references/rich-thread-bookmark-processing.md`.
- **LangChain blog mirror pattern (Webflow migration — IMPORTANT)**: LangChain migrated their blog from `blog.langchain.com` to `www.langchain.com/blog/` (Webflow-hosted). When searching for X Article mirrors of LangChain posts, try `www.langchain.com/blog/<slug>` FIRST — `blog.langchain.com/<slug>` often returns 404 for articles published after the migration. The Webflow pages return full HTML content that can be extracted by stripping `<script>`/`<style>` tags. Example: `www.langchain.com/blog/the-anatomy-of-an-agent-harness` (200) vs `blog.langchain.com/the-anatomy-of-an-agent-harness` (404).
- **Don't create duplicate Vivek Trivedy pages**: He already has `vtrivedy10.md` (188 lines, canonical) + `varun-trivedy.md` (173 lines, duplicate waiting for dedup). Use `[[vtrivedy10]]` as the wikilink target.
- **Old thread retrieval failure (pre-2025 threads)**: Threads older than ~6 months may be completely irretrievable via `xurl search "conversation_id:..."` (API returns 0 results). Nitter mirrors (nitter.net, nitter.privacydev.net, xcancel.com) are frequently down. For old threads, save the available tweet fragment as a raw article with `status: TRUNCATED` and note that the full thread is inaccessible. Only enrich wiki pages if the available fragment contains a substantive standalone insight that isn't already captured.
- **Already-processed bookmark detection**: Before processing any bookmark, check if the article already exists in the wiki: (a) `grep -l "<article title>" wiki/raw/articles/*.md` for existing raw articles, (b) `grep -l "<article title>" wiki/log.md` for prior ingestion, (c) check the author's entity page Timeline/Blog sections for the article. If fully ingested by a prior pipeline, skip with a log note — don't duplicate work.
- **Entity file exists but missing from index.md (wiki drift)**: When enriching an existing entity page, verify it appears in `wiki/index.md`. Rich pages (100+ lines) can be absent from the index due to prior pipeline gaps — searching `index.md` with `search_files` may return 0 results even though the `.md` file exists. If missing, add the entity entry to the recently-updated Entities section at the same time as the enrichment. Concrete example (June 2026): `entities/openai-codex.md` (335 lines) was absent from index.md; discovered during X bookmarks enrichment and fixed in the same commit.

## Section J: X Accounts Scan (x-accounts-scan)

Cron pipeline triggered by `fetch_x_accounts.py` that scans tracked X/Twitter accounts for new posts and ingests linked articles into the wiki.

### Pipeline Chain
```
fetch_x_accounts.py (pre-run script, daily 22:30 UTC) → x-accounts-scan (agent cron)
```

### Input Format
The agent cron job receives a JSON payload with `new_posts[]` array. Each post contains:
- `id`, `created_at`, `account_handle`, `account_name`, `text`
- `external_urls[]` — URLs with `status: 200` that are external article links (GitHub, blogs, docs)
- `links[]` — each link has `url`, `domain`, `title`, `description`, `unwound_url`, `status`
- `referenced_tweet_types[]` — `["quoted"]`, `["replied_to"]`, or `[]`

### Workflow

1. **Categorize posts by AI relevance**: Scan each post's text and linked URLs. Skip non-AI posts (DIY bio, music projects, general politics, vintage computing). Keep: LLM tools, agent frameworks, model training, prompt engineering, AI safety, coding agents, ML infrastructure.

2. **Group posts by contributor**: Posts from the same account within the same scan batch often form a coherent story (e.g., a thread about a new tool release split across 2-3 tweets). Process these together.

3. **Check existing entity pages**: Before scraping, verify entity pages exist for each account. `find wiki/entities -name "*.md" | grep -i "<handle>"`. Entity pages created by `build_x_wiki.py` or prior enrichment should be enriched, not replaced.

4. **Scrape linked articles in parallel**: Use `delegate_task` with batch mode (up to 3 concurrent leaf subagents) to scrape external URLs and enrich wiki in parallel.

   **Two-batch scraping strategy (proven pattern, Jun 2026)**: Split articles by content type for efficient parallel subagent work:
   - **Batch 1 — Web articles**: Blogs, essays, policy posts, independent sites. Subagent uses `web_extract()` / `curl` + meta tag parsing for publication dates. Source: `wiki/raw/articles/` with YYYY-MM-DD_source-slug_content-slug.md naming per raw-article-filename-policy.
   - **Batch 2 — GitHub/API content**: PRs, releases, API-driven sources. Subagent uses GitHub REST API (`/pulls/:id`, `/releases/tags/:tag`) or arxiv API for papers. Bonus: detect arxiv papers behind SPA summary pages (ChapterPal, etc.) and save to both `wiki/raw/articles/` AND `wiki/raw/papers/`.
   - Each subagent receives: post text, external URLs, existing entity page paths, naming policy context
   - Subagents: scrape → save raw article → return summary of files created
   - ⚠️ In subagent `context`, include tag hygiene instructions: "Use ONLY canonical tags from SCHEMA.md. Check `~/wiki/SCHEMA.md`."

5. **Create/enrich wiki pages in parallel**: After raw articles are saved, use a second `delegate_task` batch for wiki page creation:
   - **Batch 1 — New concept/entity pages + existing page updates**: Create new pages (`write_file`), enrich existing rich pages (`patch` only, never `write_file` on >40-line pages). Each subagent handles 3-4 wiki targets.
   - **Batch 2 — Remaining entity/concept updates**: Entity pages for authors/organizations mentioned in articles.
   - Each subagent: read raw article → read existing wiki page (if any) → create or patch → update index.md and log.md → run pre-commit validation
   - Subagents report which pages they created or updated for reconciliation

6. **Reconcile parallel subagent changes**: After all subagents complete, index.md and log.md will have been modified by each. Read the final state and fix:
   - **Index counts**: Recalculate total page counts — each subagent may have independently bumped them
   - **Entity entry concatenation**: Subagent patches to entity index entries may have concatenated new descriptions onto old ones. `grep` for each enriched entity and verify the description line is clean
   - **Alphabetical order**: New concept entries may be misplaced; verify with `grep -n "concepts/<new-page>" wiki/index.md`
   - **log.md ordering**: Multiple subagents may prepend entries out of order — re-read and verify timestamp sequence

6. **Fix tag violations before commit**: After all subagent work, run pre-commit validation or manually verify tags:
   ```bash
   grep -h "^tags:" wiki/concepts/*.md wiki/entities/*.md | grep -v SCHEMA
   ```
   Fix any non-canonical tags using the patterns in General Pipeline Pitfalls → Subagent tag hygiene.

7. **Commit and push**: `cd ~/ai-topics && git add wiki/ && git commit -m 'wiki: X accounts scan — <summary>' && git push`

8. **Generate Japanese report**: Final response is the Discord-delivered Japanese report. Format:
   - Scan summary (accounts scanned, posts found, posts processed)
   - Per-contributor sections with 🔴🟠🟡🟢 priority markers
   - Each section: post text excerpt, linked URL(s), key findings, wiki changes (🆕 created / ✏️ enriched)
   - Skipped posts with reason
   - Statistics table (new concepts, enriched concepts, enriched entities, raw articles saved, total page count delta)

### Key Pitfalls

- **Non-AI posts in scan**: The scan captures ALL posts from tracked accounts, including non-AI content. Accounts like Jonathan Whitaker (`@johnowhitaker`) post about DIY bio, music projects, and science communication alongside AI content. Filter aggressively.
- **Same-project multiple posts**: Daniel van Strien posted 3 times about 2 projects (polars-hf + uv-scripts-for-ai) — group by project, not by post. Lance Martin's 2 posts were both about Claude Opus 4.8 tips — process together.
- **JS-rendered doc sites**: `platform.claude.com` pages are Next.js SPAs — `curl` returns partial server-rendered content. Extract visible text by stripping `<script>`/`<style>` tags; the server-side content between JS chunks is usually sufficient for raw articles.
- **Subagent index.md merge conflicts**: Three parallel subagents all modify index.md. After they complete, read the file fresh and reconcile counts. The section header count (`## Concepts (N pages)`) frequently drifts from the header count.
- **Entity index entry concatenation (specific pattern)**: When subagents `patch` entity descriptions in index.md, they may only match the prefix of the existing description line. Result: `- [[entities/name]] — new description — old description still appended`. Fix by reading the line after patching and using a second `patch` to remove the concatenated portion.
- **`execute_code` blocked in cron mode**: Use `write_file` + `terminal python3` for batch operations.
- **Pipe-to-interpreter security scanner blocks `cmd | python3` in cron mode**: The `curl | python3 -c "..."` pattern is flagged as `[HIGH] Pipe to interpreter` and blocked with `status: pending_approval`. In cron mode (no user present to approve), this causes silent failure. **Always use two-step pattern**: (1) `curl -sL "https://..." -o /tmp/file.html`, (2) `read_file` or `write_file` a Python script to `/tmp/script.py`, then `terminal python3 /tmp/script.py`. This applies to ALL content extraction from URLs in cron jobs — never pipe curl directly to any interpreter.
- **`file` command may be unavailable**: Some minimal Linux environments lack the `file` utility. Use `wc -c` for file size, check HTTP status codes from curl, or read file headers with `read_file` instead.
- **Invisible Unicode in X API responses triggers cron injection scanner**: X Article `plain_text` and other X API response fields may contain invisible Unicode (U+200B zero-width space, etc.) that blocks the entire cron run. `fetch_x_bookmarks.py` sanitizes recursively via `_sanitize_dict()`. If a cron job shows `BLOCKED: prompt contains invisible unicode`, see `references/cron-injection-unicode-block.md` for diagnostics.

### Deliverable Format (cron)
Japanese-language report auto-delivered to Discord. See `references/x-accounts-scan-report.md` for the report template and formatting standards.

> **ℹ️ `wiki-daily-report` collision RESOLVED (2026-09-11 curator pass)**: The duplicate local copy at `~/.hermes/skills/wiki-daily-report/` was archived (the override at `config/hermes/skills/_overrides/wiki-daily-report/` is now the single canonical copy), so bare `skill_view(name='wiki-daily-report')` resolves again. For report formatting guidance prefer `skill_view(name='wiki-daily-report')` or `skill_view(name='wiki-ingestion-pipelines', file_path='references/x-accounts-scan-report.md')`. The `dreaming` and `daily-rss-triage` collisions were likewise resolved earlier (local duplicates archived, repo copy canonical).

### ⚠️ Cross-Pipeline Same-Day Enrichment Collision

The x-accounts-scan pipeline runs at **22:30 UTC** — well after the morning pipelines (blog-ingest 07:50, newsletter-ingest 07:40, active-crawl 11:00, trending-topics 12:00). By the time x-accounts-scan runs, concept pages touched by those pipelines may already contain content from the same day's news cycle.

**Detection**: Before creating a new concept page from an x-accounts-scan article, check if a related concept page was already enriched today:
```bash
# Check git log for same-day commits touching related concept pages
git log --oneline --since="YYYY-MM-DD" -- wiki/concepts/<related-slug>.md
# Check index.md for same-day enrichment notes
grep "(June XX)" wiki/index.md | grep -i "<topic keyword>"
```

**Resolution patterns**:

1. **Concept page already exists + same-day enrichment → sub-topic page**: If the existing concept page already covers the general topic (e.g., `concepts/computer-use.md` enriched with Gemini announcement on same day), create a more specific sub-topic page (e.g., `concepts/gemini-computer-use.md` for Android-specific implementation) and add bidirectional cross-links:
   - From existing page: "See [[concepts/gemini-computer-use]] for the Android-specific implementation guide..."
   - From new page: "See [[concepts/computer-use]] for the general computer use agent landscape..."

2. **Concept page already exists + fully covered → entity enrichment only**: If the existing concept page already has comprehensive coverage and the x-accounts-scan article adds no new conceptual angle, enrich the contributor's entity page instead (add to "Key Work", "Core Ideas", or "Blog / Recent Posts").

3. **No existing concept page → normal creation**: Proceed with new concept page creation as usual.

**Concrete example (June 25, 2026)**: `concepts/computer-use.md` was enriched by blog-ingest with "Gemini 3.5 Flash Computer Use (June 2026)" during the morning pipeline. When x-accounts-scan found Philipp Schmid's Android-specific computer use guide at 22:30 UTC, pattern 1 was applied: `concepts/gemini-computer-use.md` was created as an Android-specific sub-topic with bidirectional links.

---\n\n## JS-Rendered Site Workaround (companion GitHub repo)

Many modern doc sites (Next.js SPAs) render sub-page content client-side, so `web_extract()` returns empty results on all pages except the SSR'd landing page.

**Solution**: Check the main landing page for a companion GitHub repo link (usually a "View on GitHub" badge or footer link). Clone the repo — it typically contains markdown READMEs and source code for each module/lesson.

See `references/cron-safe-web-scraping.md` for the two-stage fetch-then-process pattern.
See `references/js-rendered-docs-workarounds.md` for the full workflow, detection patterns, and the Braintrust Evals 101 case study.
See `references/delegate-task-web-extraction-fallback.md` for the `delegate_task` + `web` toolset pattern when terminal/execute_code network access is blocked.

**Opposite pattern — sites that APPEAR complex but ARE SSR-capable**: Some sites (e.g., alphaxiv.org) were misclassified by triage as JS-rendered or "no article" but actually return full HTML via curl. See `references/site-specific-fetchability.md` for confirmed SSR-capable sites and the triage misclassification recovery workflow.

## Manual Article Ingest Patterns

See `references/reddit-url-resolution-pattern.md` for blocked Reddit URLs; `references/candidate-viability-gate.md` for the active-crawl gate.

See `references/manual-article-ingest-patterns.md` for:
- **Author identification** via secondary search when `web_extract()` omits the byline
- **Related-concept detection** — checking existing pages before creating new ones
- **Author/org/product mapping** — which entities to create from a single article
- **MCP tool identification** — extracting tool names from article data source mentions
- **Pattern 6: Substack multi-part series batch discovery** — checking `/archive` to find all parts when given part 1 only

---

## Section K: Course / Lecture Series Portal Page Creation

When ingesting a multi-lecture course (e.g., Maven courses, workshop series), create a structured portal page that spans multiple wiki directories (`concepts/`, `transcripts/`, `raw/articles/`, `entities/`). The portal page must include an **Ecosystem Context** section explaining what platforms/services the course serves as onboarding for, and bidirectional links to instructor entities, platform entities, and related concept pages.

See `references/course-portal-page-creation.md` for the full architecture, portal page template, bidirectional linking checklist, and per-lecture ingestion workflow.

Key pattern: The portal page is `type: concept` (not entity). Each transcript ingestion updates the portal's lecture table with wikilinks. Related concept pages (e.g., `agentic-search.md`) get a "Related Course Materials" section linking back to the portal and transcripts.

---

## Cross-Cutting Concept Page Creation

When multiple entities converge on a shared theme (e.g., multi-model synthesis across 3 providers), create a cross-cutting concept page that ties them together. See `references/cross-cutting-concept-page-pattern.md` for the full workflow: research → create concept page → cascade entity updates → index/log.

## General Pipeline Pitfalls

- **Always orient first** — read SCHEMA.md + index + recent log before any operation
- **Language policy**: Triage JSON `reason_ja`/`summary_ja` may be Japanese (checkpoint files in `.hermes/cron/data/`), but ALL wiki body content (`entities/`, `concepts/`, `comparisons/`, `queries/`, `events/`, `index.md`, `log.md`) must be in English. The pre-commit hook blocks Japanese text in wiki pages. Real failure (2026-06-04): dreaming-wiki-ingest wrote Japanese headings and body text into `concepts/legal-agent-benchmark.md` and `entities/cohere.md`, requiring re-patch before commit. When working from triage JSON, translate all wiki content to English even though the triage reasoning is in Japanese.
   - **⚠️ CJK proper nouns also blocked**: Even legitimate proper nouns with CJK characters (company names like 智谱AI, person names or places with kanji/hanzi) are blocked by the pre-commit hook's CJK scanner. Always use the Latin/English transcription instead (e.g., `Zhipu AI` not `智谱AI`; `Tokyo` not `東京`). This applies to entity descriptions, index.md entries, and any non-raw/ wiki page. Confirmed June 2026: `智谱AI` in index.md blocked the newsletter-ingest commit.
- **Detect follow-up batches** — check log.md for same source before creating pages
- **Escape-drift on YAML frontmatter patches**: Add to markdown References section instead
- **Partial-match corruption on patch** — When `old_string` matches only a PREFIX of a target line (not the full content), the patch tool replaces only the matched portion and appends the REMAINING original text onto your new content. **Fix:** Always include enough trailing context in `old_string` to uniquely identify the ENTIRE line — preferably the full text of the line from the file. Verify by reading the file first with `read_file(offset, limit)` and using the exact bytes shown. After every patch on index files, immediately re-read the affected lines to check for appended garbage text. If corruption occurred, fix with a second patch that replaces the corrupted substring.
- **Markdown table leading-pipe corruption (specific variant)** — When patching markdown table rows in entity pages (e.g., `| **May 2026** | Published ...`), the leading `|` pipe character is part of the file content but can easily be omitted from `old_string`. When the patch tool finds a partial match without the leading pipe, it inserts the new content at the match boundary, producing `||` double-pipe corruption at the line start. **Fix:** (1) Read the file first to confirm the exact content including the leading `|`. (2) Include the FULL line in both `old_string` and `new_string`, starting with `| `. (3) After patching, immediately re-read the affected lines to check for `||` corruption. (4) If `||` is present at the beginning of a line, use a second patch fixing `||` → `|` at those lines. This is most likely to happen when adding new rows to career timeline tables, sources lists, or comparison tables in entity pages.
- **Context compaction can mask prior work** — review compaction summary for already-completed tasks
- **Commit message `&` trap**: The terminal tool interprets `&` as shell backgrounding. If your commit message contains `&` (e.g., `set_to_none=True`, `agents & tools`), use **single quotes**: `git commit -m 'wiki: safe message here'`. Double quotes fail silently. Also, `&&` chaining triggers the tool's backgrounding detection — split into separate `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` calls when `&&` chaining fails.
- **Tag validation blocks commits**: The pre-commit hook (`~/.githooks/pre-commit-tag-validator.py`) checks every YAML frontmatter `tags:` entry against SCHEMA.md's canonical taxonomy. If a tag isn't in SCHEMA.md, the commit is blocked with a violation message. Fix: (a) check SCHEMA.md for an existing canonical tag that matches your intent (e.g., use `sandbox` instead of inventing `agent-sandboxing`), or (b) add the new tag to SCHEMA.md before committing. Do NOT use `--no-verify` to bypass — the curator workflow expects tag hygiene.
   - **⚠️ Tag proximity trap**: The pre-commit hook catches tags that don't exist in SCHEMA.md, but it's easy to invent a tag that's SIMILAR to the canonical one but not identical. Example: using `rl-training` when SCHEMA.md has `reinforcement-learning`. Before adding ANY new tag, search SCHEMA.md (`grep -i "keyword" wiki/SCHEMA.md`) for near-matches. In June 2026, `rl-training` was blocked and had to be replaced with the existing `reinforcement-learning` — saving a round-trip. This also applies to entity tags: check for `company` (not `startup`), `open-source` (not `os`), `ai-safety` (not `alignment`), `ml-research` (not `ml-researcher`).\n   - **⚠️ SCHEMA.md bold marker requirement — entire category silently excluded (CRITICAL)**: The pre-commit tag validator (`pre-commit-tag-validator.py`) extracts valid tags using TWO mechanisms: (a) backtick-quoted tags (`` `tag-name` ``), and (b) bold-prefixed comma-separated categories (`- **Category**: tag1, tag2`). If a SCHEMA category line lacks `**` bold markers around the category name (e.g., `- AI Agents:` instead of `- **AI Agents**:`), ALL tags on that line are **silently excluded** from the valid tag set. The validator won't warn about the formatting — it just won't see any of those tags, and your commit will be blocked with violations for tags that appear to be IN SCHEMA.md but aren't recognized. **Detection**: if `grep 'tag-name' wiki/SCHEMA.md` finds the tag but the pre-commit hook reports it missing, check that the category line has `**` markers. **Fix**: add `**` around the category name on that line. **Confirmed June 2026**: x-accounts-scan commit blocked — 10 tag violations including `agent-skills`, `agent-workflows`, `agent-tooling` which were all present in SCHEMA line 37 but invisible because `- AI Agents:` lacked bold markers. Fix: changed to `- **AI Agents**:` — instantly resolved all 10 violations.
   - **⚠️ Course/lecture content tag mappings (common traps)**: When ingesting lecture transcripts and summaries, these non-obvious mappings are frequent pitfalls:
     | Invented tag | Correct SCHEMA.md tag | Notes |
     |---|---|---|
     | `async-processing` | `async-agents` | Under "AI Agents" taxonomy, not "Engineering" |
     | `logging` | `observability` | Under "Engineering"; `monitoring` also exists |
     | `agent-sandboxing` | `sandbox` | Under "Models" taxonomy |
     | `prompt-engineering` | `prompting` | Shorter canonical form |
     | `data-processing` | `data-science` | Broader canonical category |
     | `tooling` | `tool` or `developer-tools` | Context-dependent |
     | `open-weights` (plural) | `open-weight` (singular) | SCHEMA.md has singular form; subagents pluralize by default |
     | `life-sciences` | `biology` + `biotech` | Under "Domain Concepts"; use both or pick one based on focus |
     | `drug-discovery` | `biotech` or `evaluation` | Under "Domain Concepts" or "Models" taxonomy |
     | `llm-evaluation` | `evaluation` | SCHEMA.md uses bare `evaluation`; subagents invent compound `llm-` prefix |
   - **⚠️ Pre-existing tag violations block unrelated commits**: The pre-commit hook scans ALL staged files, not just your changes. If a pre-existing file (e.g., `gpt-4-system-card.md`) has a tag violation (`hallucinations`, `disinformation`), your commit of completely unrelated files will be blocked. **Fix**: Use selective `git add` with explicit file paths instead of `git add wiki/`. Example: `git add wiki/transcripts/my-file.md wiki/raw/articles/my-other-file.md wiki/index.md wiki/log.md`. This stages ONLY your files, bypassing the pre-existing violation. **Verify with `git diff --cached --name-only`** before committing to confirm only intended files are staged. Never use `--no-verify` to bypass — the pre-existing violation should be fixed separately.
- **⚠️ Content regression blocks commits (CRITICAL)**: The pre-commit hook `.githooks/pre-commit-content-regression.py` detects when entity/concept pages shrink by >50 lines AND >50%. This catches the #1 recurring wiki data-loss pattern: an ingestion pipeline overwriting a rich curated page with a skeleton/stub. **58 documented regression events** across 9 destructive commits (worst: `7b69b67d` with 15 pages, `383eff68` with 14 pages). **Prevention**: Before ANY `write_file` to `wiki/entities/` or `wiki/concepts/`, `read_file` the existing page first. If it has >40 lines, use `patch` to add content — NEVER `write_file` to replace it. **Recovery**: When enriching a damaged page, always check `git log` for a richer historical version first — restore the richest version as base, merge any genuinely new content, then `patch` new info on top. See `wiki-entity-enrichment-from-article` skill's `references/pre-write-verification.md` for the full protocol, git history enrichment 4-step pattern, and `references/content-regression-scanner.sh` for scanning the commit history. **Cron prompt enforcement**: All ingestion cron jobs (raw-backlog-ingest, x-bookmarks-ingest, skeleton-enrich-daily, newsletter-wiki-ingest, blog-wiki-ingest) must include an explicit anti-overwrite warning in their prompt preamble.
- **Patch tool Unicode escape-drift in cron mode**: When enriching wiki pages from articles with smart quotes, em-dashes, or CJK characters, `patch` frequently fails with "Escape-drift detected". The cron-safe workaround is `write_file` a Python script to `/tmp/` and run it with `terminal`. This also handles multi-section insertions that would otherwise require multiple sequential patch calls. See `references/comprehensive-article-multi-page-cascade.md` for the Python script template.
- **⚠️ `write_file` on append-only files destroys ALL history (CRITICAL)**: `write_file` OVERWRITES the entire file — it does NOT prepend or append. Using `write_file` on `log.md` or any append-only file destroys all prior content irrecoverably (unless git-tracked). **Always use the Python prepend pattern** described below, even outside cron mode. If you accidentally overwrite, recover immediately with `git checkout HEAD -- <path>`. Confirmed June 2026: `write_file` on log.md destroyed 20KB/229 lines of history; recovered via `git checkout HEAD -- wiki/log.md`. The correct pattern is: (1) `write_file` a Python prepend script to `/tmp/prepend_log.py`, (2) `terminal python3 /tmp/prepend_log.py`.
- **Log.md append in cron mode**: Use `echo '...' >> ~/wiki/log.md` for appending entries. Heredoc (`cat << EOF >> file`) may be blocked by the pipe-to-interpreter scanner. Plain `echo >>` works reliably for single-line and multi-line entries (use single quotes to avoid shell interpolation of `&`, `!`, `$`). For complex entries with special characters, use the Python script pattern: `write_file` to `/tmp/append_log.py` then `terminal python3 /tmp/append_log.py`. — Log.md is append-only with newest entries at top. In cron mode, `execute_code` is blocked, so you cannot prepend programmatically. Two reliable workarounds:

  **Option A — Python script (preferred)**: Write a complete Python script to `/tmp/` via `write_file`, then execute with `terminal python3`. This is cleaner than `cat` merge — single step, handles large files (8200+ lines) reliably, works with Unicode and special characters:
  ```python
  # /tmp/prepend_log.py
  new_entry = \"\"\"## [YYYY-MM-DD] Title

  Body...

  \"\"\"
  log_path = "~/wiki/log.md"
  with open(log_path) as f: current = f.read()
  with open(log_path, 'w') as f: f.write(new_entry + current)
  ```
  Verified June 2026: 8200-line log.md (659KB) handled without issue in a single terminal call.

  **Option B — `cat` merge pattern**: (1) `write_file` the new log entry to `/tmp/log_new_entry.md`, (2) `cat /tmp/log_new_entry.md ~/wiki/log.md > /tmp/log_merged.md && mv /tmp/log_merged.md ~/wiki/log.md`. This avoids both the `execute_code` block and pipe-to-interpreter detection.

  Do NOT use `sed -i '1i...'` — it fails on large files with embedded special characters. Do NOT try `tail -r` or similar pipe chains — blocked by the scanner.
- **Total page count in index.md header AND section header must be correct** — After creating a new page, update TWO counts in index.md: (a) the header count at the top (`Total pages: N | Indexed entries: M | Concepts: X | Entities: Y`), and (b) the section header count (e.g., `## Concepts (N pages)`). Both must match. Forgetting the section header count causes drift where the index says 946 but the section header says 945.<br>_Concrete pattern from blog-wiki-ingest (Jun 2026):_ Created 1 new concept → Concepts went 945→946 in both the header AND `## Concepts (946 pages)`. The top-level Total pages and Indexed entries also increment by 1 each.
- **concepts/_index.md drift**: Many wikis have a separate `concepts/_index.md` listing concepts by category. Creating or enriching concept pages without updating this causes index drift. Always update BOTH `wiki/index.md` (main index) and any sub-index files (`concepts/_index.md`, `entities/_index.md` if they exist) when adding new pages.
- **New files invisible to `git add` after auto-commit**: If a cron job or auto-sync mechanism committed your new wiki files before your batch commit, `git status` won't show them and `git add` won't stage them. Verify with `git ls-files | grep <new-file-name>`. If the file shows as tracked but `git diff HEAD --stat` doesn't include it, it was already committed — just commit the remaining modifications.
- **Subagents need explicit absolute paths** — don't rely on HOME resolution
- **⚠️ Sibling subagent `/tmp/` race condition on write_file (CRITICAL)**: When multiple subagents (or a sibling pipeline subagent running in the same 07:00-07:50 UTC window) write to the same `/tmp/<name>.py` path, `write_file` emits a warning but still overwrites the file. The subsequent `terminal python3` then runs the WRONG content. Observed June 2026: sibling subagent wrote its tag-fix script to `/tmp/fix_tags.py` while the main pipeline agent was about to run the same filename. Result: `wiki/concepts/hornet.md` was shrunk from 132→47 lines (content regression), caught only by the pre-commit hook. **Prevention**: Always use unique filenames per pipeline: `/tmp/<pipeline>_triage_<date>.py` or `/tmp/<pipeline>_fix_<date>.py`. If you see a `write_file` warning about sibling modification, re-read the file with `read_file` before executing to confirm content integrity. If a page was corrupted by this pattern, restore with `git checkout HEAD -- <path>` and re-apply only the intended change via `patch`.
- **⚠️ Subagent tag hygiene (CRITICAL — 25 violations in one batch, June 2026)**: Parallel subagents creating concept/entity pages routinely use non-canonical tags not in SCHEMA.md. The pre-commit hook will block the entire commit for ALL violations across ALL files — you can't partially commit. **Prevention workflow**:
  1. In subagent task `context` fields, include the full content quality rules from `references/subagent-content-quality-guardrails.md`. This covers tag hygiene, pipe-prefix prevention, CJK blocking, and wikilink format — all in one copy-pasteable block.
  2. After all subagents complete, run the post-subagent verification commands from `references/subagent-content-quality-guardrails.md` (pipe-prefix scan, tag validation, CJK scan).
  3. If violations exist, fix them before attempting `git commit`. Use `patch` for inline-format tags (`tags: [a, b, c]`) and the Python script pattern for multi-line format.
  4. Never use `--no-verify` to bypass — fix the tags properly.
- **⚠️ Wikilink target validation before creating links (CRITICAL)**: Before creating `[[entities/name]]` or `[[concepts/name]]` wikilinks in ANY wiki page, verify the target exists. **Preferred method**: `search_files(pattern="page-slug", path="wiki/index.md", target="content")` — index.md is a single file without symlink ambiguity. **Fallback**: `search_files(pattern="page-slug", path="wiki/entities", target="content")` (searches file *content*, NOT filenames — `target="files"` searches content too, it does NOT search filenames). **⚠️ `search_files(target='files')` with `path="~/wiki"` can return false negatives** due to symlink resolution issues (documented in `pre-write-verification.md`). Always cross-check with index.md content search or `git log -- 'wiki/entities/<slug>.md'`. Transcripts, summaries, and enrichment outputs frequently reference projects, tools, and organizations that lack wiki pages. **Two resolution strategies**: (1) Create a stub entity/concept page, or (2) use a raw article link instead (e.g., `[[raw/articles/2025-04-14_corbt_art-trainer-new-rl-trainer]]` instead of `[[concepts/art-agent-reinforcement-trainer]]`). Existing pages may use different slugs than expected — search broadly (e.g., `search_files(pattern="*corbitt*", target="content")` to find both `entities/kyle-corbitt.md` AND `concepts/corbett-kyle-corbitt.md`).
- **⚠️ Patch tool wikilink escaping in markdown tables**: When using `patch` to edit markdown tables with wikilinks containing `|` (pipe) characters, the patch tool may double-escape them (`|` → `\\|`), corrupting wikilink rendering. **Fix**: After patching, immediately `read_file` the affected lines and check for escaped pipes. If present, do a second `patch` to restore correct formatting.
- **Patch duplicate-section creation from non-unique old_string**: When using `patch` with `replace_all=false` (default), the tool requires a unique `old_string`. If your `old_string` matches multiple locations (e.g., `## X Activity Themes` or `---`), the patch will fail. If you used a non-unique match that succeeded, you may get unexpected insertions. **Always read the file first** with `read_file` to find unique context (2-3 surrounding lines) for your `old_string`. After patching, verify with another `read_file` to catch unintended duplications. Concrete case (Jun 2026): patching ethan-mollick.md duplicated the Claude Fable paragraph because the trailing newline boundary matched twice.
- **YAML tag format duality — inline vs multi-line**: Wiki pages use TWO different YAML tag formats. Some have inline: `tags: [concept, claude-code, model]`. Others have multi-line: `tags:\n  - tool\n  - open-source`. When writing fix scripts or patching tags, you MUST handle both formats. A script that only looks for `  - oldtag\n` (multi-line) will miss inline `[oldtag]` violations and the commit will still be blocked. **Detection**: `grep -n "^tags:" <file>`

- **⚠️ YAML sources list duplication trap**: When patching the YAML frontmatter `sources:` field to add a new raw article/newsletter path, the path frequently appears in BOTH the frontmatter AND the page body text (as a `Source: [[raw/...]]` wikilink or markdown reference). The `patch` tool then fails with `Found 2 matches`. This happens because many wiki pages list sources in both places — frontmatter for machine readability, body text for human readability.

  **Symptom**: `patch` returns `error: "Found 2 matches"` when you use the last existing source line as context for insertion.

  **Fix**: Provide more context in `old_string` that includes the YAML closing `|---` delimiter AND the next heading line to make the match unique. Example — when adding to the end of the sources list, include the heading that follows `|---`:
  ```
  # Bad — matches both frontmatter and body text:
  old_string = "  - raw/articles/some-path.md\n|---"

  # Good — includes page heading to force frontmatter-only match:
  old_string = "  - raw/articles/some-path.md\n---\n\n# Page Title"
  ```

  **Detection**: Before patching sources, grep for the nearest unique raw path to confirm it appears only once in the file. If it appears twice, use the heading context technique above.

  **Observed June 2026**: `concepts/ai-regulation-2026.md` — the apple raw article path appeared in both the `sources:` frontmatter and the DMA section body. Workaround: included the page heading `# AI Reg` in the match context. — if the line contains `[`, it's inline format; if the next line starts with `  -`, it's multi-line. **Fix inline format** with `patch` (old_string = exact `tags: [...]` line). **Fix multi-line format** with a Python script or individual `patch` calls per tag. See `references/parallel-enrichment-pitfalls.md` for parallel enrichment log.md race fixes, `\n` literal trap, and `replace_all=true` source list hazard.
