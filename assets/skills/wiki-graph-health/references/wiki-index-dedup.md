# Index Deduplication

Pattern for detecting and removing duplicate entries from `wiki/index.md`. See also the **False-Positive Trap** in `llm-wiki` skill — inline cross-references in description text are NOT duplicates.

## Pre-check: Primary vs All Wikilinks

When a report claims N duplicate index entries, filter by **line-starting (primary) wikilinks** first:

```python
# Primary (line-starting) — correct for dedup
m = re.match(r'^- \[\[(entities|concepts|comparisons|queries|events)/([^|\]]+)', line)
key = f"{m.group(1)}/{m.group(2)}"

# ALL wikilinks — inflated by inline cross-refs (wrong for dedup)
all_links = re.findall(r'\[\[(entities|concepts|comparisons|queries|events)/([^|\]]+)\]\]', content)
```

Observed: 48 of 67 reported "duplicates" were inline cross-references. Only act on primary-link duplicates.

## Cluster Detection for Contiguous Duplicate Blocks

When N primary duplicates survive filtering, check if they form a **contiguous block** (consecutive lines at positions L+1..L+N that mirror L-N-1..L-1 with identical text). If yes, it's a single bulk-duplication incident, not N independent issues:

```python
import re
with open('wiki/index.md') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

prev_slug, cluster_start = None, None
for i, line in enumerate(lines):
    m = re.match(r'^- \[\[(entities|concepts|comparisons|queries|events)/([^|\]]+)', line.strip())
    if m:
        slug = f"{m.group(1)}/{m.group(2)}"
        if slug == prev_slug and cluster_start is None:
            cluster_start = i - 1
        elif slug != prev_slug:
            cluster_start = None
        prev_slug = slug
```

**Fix**: Remove the entire duplicate block in one operation (not N individual pair removals). Verify by re-running the primary-link count.

## Detection

```bash
grep -n '^- \[' wiki/index.md | cut -d' ' -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

## Skeleton-vs-Rich from build_x_wiki.py

When a skeleton entry (`**X/Twitter**`, `**Name**`, `**Blog**`) duplicates an existing rich entry: keep the rich entry, remove the skeleton.

## Adjacent Duplicate Blocks (Consecutive Lines)

When two entries for the same slug appear back-to-back, remove BOTH in a SINGLE `patch` operation covering all adjacent lines plus one surrounding line each side.

## Safety Checks After Dedup

```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/validate_index.py
grep -n '[[entities/<slug>]]' wiki/index.md  # count == 1 for primary, >1 is inline cross-refs
```

## Post-Dedup Header Count Verification

After removing duplicate entries, **always re-verify the section header count** matches the actual `- [[...]]` entry lines:

```bash
# Count actual entries in the section
grep -c '^- \[\[concepts/' wiki/index.md   # should match ## Concepts header
```

**2026-08-24 worked example**: Dedup removed 1 ghost entry + added 1 orphan (net −1 from 2008 → 2007), but the true entry count was 2006 (the prior day's watchdog had set the header to the recursive file count of 2008, not the entry count). After the dedup edit, the header was 2007 but actual entries were 2006 — a 1-entry gap that required a second patch to correct. Rule: after any index edit that changes entry counts, run `grep -c` and patch the header to match exactly.

## Automated Script

For bulk dedup:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import re

with open("wiki/index.md") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

entries = defaultdict(list)
for i, line in enumerate(lines):
    m = re.match(r'- \[\[(.*?)(?:\||\])', line.strip())
    if m and not m.group(1).endswith('/_index'):
        entries[m.group(1)].append(i)

lines_to_remove = set()
for key, indices in entries.items():
    if len(indices) > 1:
        todo = [i for i in indices if '**TODO**' in lines[i] or 'Enrich this page' in lines[i]]
        rich = [i for i in indices if i not in todo]
        if rich:
            lines_to_remove.update(rich[1:])
        lines_to_remove.update(todo)

for idx in sorted(lines_to_remove, reverse=True):
    lines.pop(idx)
```

## Rules
- `[[entities/foo]]` and `[[concepts/foo]]` are NOT duplicates if both files exist
- `_index` entries are legitimate — never remove
- Remove bottom-up to preserve line numbers
- Verify against `os.path.exists()` after dedup
