# Person-Link Gap Remediation (from `wiki_graph.py --format json`)

The precise, re-verifiable source of "add a wikilink between two person pages" work.
Validated 2026-08-27 (closed 15 gaps, 30 bidirectional links, `gap_recommendations` → 0).

## The data source

`wiki_graph.py --format json` output has two relevant keys:

- **`person_similarity`** — raw scored person pairs. Includes `direct_link: True` pairs (already linked — NOT gaps) and page-split artifacts like `X` ↔ `X--core-ideas` / `X--projects` (NOT gaps). Do NOT use this as the fix list.
- **`gap_recommendations`** — pairs that share concepts/tags but have **no direct wikilink in either direction**. Each entry: `{'type':'person_link_missing','from','to','score','reason','shared':[...]}`. **This is the fix list.**

```python
import json
d = json.load(open('/tmp/wiki_graph.json'))
gaps = d.get('gap_recommendations', [])
for g in gaps:
    print(f"{g['score']:>5}  {g['from']} <-> {g['to']}  shared={g['shared'][:3]}")
```

## Workflow

1. **Run fresh, don't trust the report.** The weekly markdown report (in `wiki/queries/`) can be days old and its pair list is NOT exhaustive. Always re-run:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ai-topics && python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/wiki_graph.py --format json > /tmp/wiki_graph.json
   ```
   2026-08-27: the 6-day-old report listed 14 gaps; a fresh run revealed a **15th** (eleanor-berger↔hamel-husain, 12.0).
2. **Triage each gap:**
   - Skip if either target is a skeleton/stub (<200 chars) or `status: redirect` — link to the canonical target instead.
   - Skip page-split pairs (`--core-ideas`, `--projects`, `--subsection`) — these are sub-pages of the same person, not a real missing link.
   - Everything else is a genuine person-link gap.
3. **Add the link in BOTH directions (symmetric).** For each pair, read the `## Related` / `## Related People` / `## Cross-References` / `## See Also` section of BOTH pages and append:
   ```
   - [[entities/<other>]] — <one-line shared-interest note>
   ```
   A brief shared-interest blurb is sufficient (e.g. "Fellow agentic engineering commentator; shared harness-engineering interests"). Depth is not required for a graph link.
   - Use the `patch` tool with a **unique multi-line anchor** = the section header + first 1-2 existing bullets.
   - Match the existing bullet style of that section (some use `- [[x]] — note`, some use `- **[[x|Name]]** — note`, some use table rows).
4. **Commit after each logical batch** (a batch = one person's partners, or a contiguous score range). Stage only the files you touched.
5. **Re-verify against the graph (the definitive check):**
   ```bash
   cd ~/ai-topics && python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/wiki_graph.py --format json > /tmp/wiki_graph_after.json
   python3 - << 'PYEOF'
   import json
   d = json.load(open('/tmp/wiki_graph_after.json'))
   gaps = d.get('gap_recommendations', [])
   print('remaining person_link_missing gaps:', len(gaps))
   for g in gaps: print(f"  {g['score']} {g['from']} <-> {g['to']}")
   PYEOF
   ```
   Target: 0 (or 0 for the specific pairs you fixed). Grep-ing for the new link text only proves the text was written, NOT that the graph now resolves it — the re-run is the real verification.

## Cron-mode gotchas

- **`execute_code` is blocked in cron mode.** Read the JSON via `terminal()` with a `python3 /dev/stdin << 'PYEOF'` heredoc.
- **The security scanner rejects `cat file | python3`** ("Pipe to interpreter: HIGH"). Workaround: write the JSON to `/tmp` first (a normal redirect), then open it in a standalone script (`python3 /dev/stdin << 'PYEOF' ... open('/tmp/x.json') ...`). Never pipe into an interpreter.
- **Patching files a sibling subagent touched**: the `patch` tool may warn "modified by sibling subagent X but this agent never read it." Re-read the exact region with `sed -n 'M,Np'` (clean, no line-number framing) before re-applying if the anchor no longer matches.

## What counts as a "person-link gap" vs a false positive

| Pair type | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Two real people, shared concepts, no link | ✅ Add bidirectional link |
| `X` ↔ `X--core-ideas` / `X--projects` | ❌ Skip — page-split sub-page, same person |
| Either side is `status: redirect` | ❌ Skip — link to canonical target |
| Either side is a skeleton/stub (<200 chars) | ⚠️ Defer until enriched, or link to canonical |
| `direct_link: True` in `person_similarity` | ❌ Already linked — not a gap |

## Scale / volume expectation

Typical weekly: 10-20 person-link gaps (score 10-22). All auto-fixable with the symmetric-link pattern above. A full pass is one session; each link is a single `patch` call. Total files touched ≈ 2 × pair-count (both directions), often less when one page is a hub (e.g. wes-mckinney appeared in 3 gaps).
