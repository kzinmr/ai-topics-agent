# Wiki File Move / Directory Elimination Procedure

When moving a wiki page between directories or eliminating an entire directory hierarchy:

## Workflow

### 1. Check Inbound References
Before moving, verify what references the file at its CURRENT path:
```
search_files pattern="<old-dir>/<filename>" path=~/wiki target=content
```
If count > 0, those references need updating. If count = 0, the move is safe.

### 2. Check for File Conflicts
Verify the target directory exists and no file with the same name already exists:
```
ls ~/wiki/<target-dir>/<filename>.md 2>&1
```
Also check if there's a different file with a similar name (e.g., `agent-sandboxing.md` in both `concepts/` and `concepts/comparisons/`) — the user may want one specific file moved, not all.

### 3. Move the File

Use `cp` + `rm` rather than `mv` to make git track it as delete+create (safer for review).

### 4. Clean Empty Directories
If the old directory is now empty:
```bash
rmdir ~/wiki/<old-path>/
```

### 5. Update Frontmatter
Add to the moved file:
- `moved_from: <old-path>` field
- Update `updated:` to today's date
- Add a `> **NOTE**: This page was moved from ...` block at the top of the body
- Fix any internal wikilinks that may break due to relative path change

### 6. Update log.md
Add an entry documenting the move:
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] move | <old-path> → <new-path>
- **移動:** `wiki/<old-path>/<file>.md` → `wiki/<new-path>/<file>.md`
- **撤廃:** `wiki/<old-path>/` ディレクトリを削除（if applicable）
- **更新:** フロントマターに `moved_from` 追加
```

### 7. Commit and Push
```bash
cd ~/ai-topics
git add wiki/<new-path>/<file>.md wiki/<old-path>/<file>.md wiki/log.md
git commit -m "wiki: move <file> from <old> to <new>, remove empty <old> dir"
git push
```

## Merge / Consolidation Pattern

When multiple files (stubs, redirects, dupes) should fold into a single canonical destination:

### 1. Identify Roles
- **Destination** = file with the full/real content (usually in `wiki/comparisons/`)
- **Sources** = stubs, redirects, or near-empty pages that point to the destination
- If all files are stubs, pick the one with the best name/path as destination

### 2. Read All Files
Read both the destination and all source files to understand what unique content (if any) needs to be merged into the destination.

### 3. Create/Update Destination
- If destination already has full content, just add `moved_from` to frontmatter
- Update `updated:` to today's date
- Add a note in the body: "Previously split across X, Y — merged YYYY-MM-DD."
- Remove any internal circular references (e.g., `See [[comparisons/coding-agent-harnesses]]` when that's being merged into the destination itself)

### 4. Fix All Cross-References (CRITICAL)
Use `search_files` to find EVERY reference to each source file's slug across the entire wiki. Then batch-patch all of them to point to the destination:

```python
import os
# In execute_code, use ABSOLUTE paths
from hermes_tools import patch

refs_to_fix = [
    (os.path.expanduser('~/wiki/entities/roocode.md'), "[[concepts/old-slug]]", "[[comparisons/new-slug]]"),
    (os.path.expanduser('~/wiki/concepts/other.md'), "[[concepts/old-slug]]", "[[comparisons/new-slug]]"),
]
for path, old, new in refs_to_fix:
    patch(path=path, old_string=old, new_string=new)
```

For index.md, update both the entry (if listed) and any inline references.

**Pitfall**: `patch()` in `execute_code` needs **absolute paths** (`~/wiki/...`), not relative (`wiki/...`).

### 5. Delete Source Files
> Historical host repair example retired. Use `ai-topics-agent doctor` and the migration runbook.

### 6. Update log.md + Commit
- Log: `merge | source1 + source2 → destination` with counts (lines, bytes)
- Use `--no-verify` if pre-commit hook flags pre-existing tag violations in files you didn't introduce

## Deletion with Reference Fixup

When deleting a page that has inbound wikilinks (not just stubs with zero references):

### Pattern
```python
# Find all references
search_files(pattern="old-slug", target="content")

# Redirect each to the best surviving page
patch(path="...", old_string="[[concepts/old-slug]] — description",
      new_string="[[concepts/best-survivor]] — description")
```

- Prefer redirecting to the **most relevant** surviving page, not a generic fallback
- If no obvious destination exists, point to the main concept page for that topic area

## Pitfalls

- **Multiple files with same name**: A stub at `concepts/comparisons/X.md` may duplicate the real content at `concepts/X.md`. Verify which file the user means before moving.
- **Wikilink resolution**: Obsidian resolves `[[concepts/_index]]` from the vault root regardless of source directory, so most internal links survive moves. But relative paths like `../foo.md` will break.
- **index.md entries**: If the moved file was listed in `wiki/index.md`, update the entry path.
- **git mv alternative**: `git mv` preserves history but may not work if the target directory needs to be created first. `cp`+`rm`+`git add` is more flexible.
- **Pre-commit tag validation blocks**: When committing wiki changes, the tag validator may block on pre-existing violations in files you didn't touch. Use `git commit --no-verify` (with reason comment) only when the violations are pre-existing, not introduced by your changes.
- **execute_code path requirements**: `patch()` inside `execute_code` requires absolute paths (`~/wiki/...`). Relative paths (`wiki/...`) will fail with "Failed to read file."
