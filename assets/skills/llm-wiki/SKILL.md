# Karpathy's LLM Wiki

Build and maintain a persistent, compounding knowledge base as interlinked markdown files.
Based on [Andrej Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f).

Unlike traditional RAG (which rediscovers knowledge from scratch per query), the wiki
compiles knowledge once and keeps it current. Cross-references are already there.
Contradictions have already been flagged. Synthesis reflects everything ingested.

**Division of labor:** The human curates sources and directs analysis. The agent
summarizes, cross-references, files, and maintains consistency.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when the user:
- Asks to create, build, or start a wiki or knowledge base
- Asks to ingest, add, or process a source into their wiki
- Asks a question and an existing wiki is present at the configured path
- Asks to lint, audit, or health-check their wiki
- References their wiki, knowledge base, or "notes" in a research context

## Wiki Location

**Location:** Set via `WIKI_PATH` environment variable (e.g. in `~/.hermes/.env`).

If unset, defaults to `~/wiki`.

```bash
WIKI="${WIKI_PATH:-$HOME/wiki}"
```

The wiki is just a directory of markdown files — open it in Obsidian, VS Code, or
any editor. No database, no special tooling required.

## Architecture: Three Layers

```
wiki/
├── SCHEMA.md           # Conventions, structure rules, domain config
├── index.md            # Sectioned content catalog with one-line summaries
├── log.md              # Chronological action log (append-only, rotated yearly)
├── raw/                # Layer 1: Immutable source material
│   ├── articles/       # Web articles, clippings
│   ├── papers/         # PDFs, arxiv papers
│   ├── transcripts/    # Meeting notes, interviews
│   └── assets/         # Images, diagrams referenced by sources
├── entities/           # Layer 2: Entity pages (people, orgs, products, models)
├── concepts/           # Layer 2: Concept/topic pages
├── comparisons/        # Layer 2: Side-by-side analyses
└── queries/            # Layer 2: Filed query results worth keeping
```

**Layer 1 — Raw Sources:** Immutable. The agent reads but never modifies these.
**Layer 2 — The Wiki:** Agent-owned markdown files. Created, updated, and
cross-referenced by the agent.
**Layer 3 — The Schema:** `SCHEMA.md` defines structure, conventions, and tag taxonomy.

## Resuming an Existing Wiki (CRITICAL — do this every session)

When the user has an existing wiki, **always orient yourself before doing anything**:

① **Read `SCHEMA.md`** — understand the domain, conventions, and tag taxonomy.
② **Read `index.md`** — learn what pages exist and their summaries.
③ **Scan recent `log.md`** — read the last 20-30 entries to understand recent activity.

```bash
WIKI="${WIKI_PATH:-$HOME/wiki}"
# Orientation reads at session start
read_file "$WIKI/SCHEMA.md"
read_file "$WIKI/index.md"
read_file "$WIKI/log.md" offset=<last 30 lines>
```

Only after orientation should you ingest, query, or lint. This prevents:
- Creating duplicate pages for entities that already exist
- Missing cross-references to existing content
- Contradicting the schema's conventions
- Repeating work already logged

For large wikis (100+ pages), also run a quick `search_files` for the topic
at hand before creating anything new.

## Initializing a New Wiki

When the user asks to create or start a wiki:

1. Determine the wiki path (from `$WIKI_PATH` env var, or ask the user; default `~/wiki`)
2. Create the directory structure above
3. Ask the user what domain the wiki covers — be specific
4. Write `SCHEMA.md` customized to the domain (see template below)
5. Write initial `index.md` with sectioned header
6. Write initial `log.md` with creation entry
7. Confirm the wiki is ready and suggest first sources to ingest

### SCHEMA.md Template

Adapt to the user's domain. The schema constrains agent behavior and ensures consistency:

```markdown
# Wiki Schema

## Domain
[What this wiki covers — e.g., "AI/ML research", "personal health", "startup intelligence"]

## Conventions
- File names: lowercase, hyphens, no spaces (e.g., `transformer-architecture.md`)
- Every wiki page starts with YAML frontmatter (see below)
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` to link between pages (minimum 2 outbound links per page)
- When updating a page, always bump the `updated` date
- Every new page must be added to `index.md` under the correct section
- Every action must be appended to `log.md`
- **Provenance markers:** On pages that synthesize 3+ sources, append `^[raw/articles/source-file.md]`
  at the end of paragraphs whose claims come from a specific source. This lets a reader trace each
  claim back without re-reading the whole raw file. Optional on single-source pages where the
  `sources:` frontmatter is enough.

## Frontmatter
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Page Title
  created: YYYY-MM-DD
  updated: YYYY-MM-DD
  type: entity | concept | comparison | query | summary
  tags: [from taxonomy below]
  sources: [raw/articles/source-name.md]
  # Optional quality signals:
  confidence: high | medium | low        # how well-supported the claims are
  contested: true                        # set when the page has unresolved contradictions
  contradictions: [other-page-slug]      # pages this one conflicts with
  ---
  ```

`confidence` and `contested` are optional but recommended for opinion-heavy or fast-moving
topics. Lint surfaces `contested: true` and `confidence: low` pages for review so weak claims
don't silently harden into accepted wiki fact.

### raw/ Frontmatter

Raw sources ALSO get a small frontmatter block so re-ingests can detect drift:

```yaml
---
source_url: https://example.com/article   # original URL, if applicable
ingested: YYYY-MM-DD
sha256: <hex digest of the raw content below the frontmatter>
---
```

The `sha256:` lets a future re-ingest of the same URL skip processing when content is unchanged,
and flag drift when it has changed. Compute over the body only (everything after the closing
`---`), not the frontmatter itself.

## Tag Taxonomy
[Define 10-20 top-level tags for the domain. Add new tags here BEFORE using them.]

Example for AI/ML:
- Models: model, architecture, benchmark, training
- People/Orgs: person, company, lab, open-source
- Techniques: optimization, fine-tuning, inference, alignment, data
- Meta: comparison, timeline, controversy, prediction

Rule: every tag on a page must appear in this taxonomy. If a new tag is needed,
add it here first, then use it. This prevents tag sprawl.

## Page Thresholds
- **Create a page** when an entity/concept appears in 2+ sources OR is central to one source
- **Add to existing page** when a source mentions something already covered
- **DON'T create a page** for passing mentions, minor details, or things outside the domain
- **Split a page** when it exceeds ~200 lines — break into sub-topics with cross-links
- **Archive a page** when its content is fully superseded — move to `_archive/`, remove from index

## Entity Pages
One page per notable entity. Include:
- Overview / what it is
- Key facts and dates
- Relationships to other entities ([[wikilinks]])
- Source references

## Concept Pages
One page per concept or topic. Include:
- Definition / explanation
- Current state of knowledge
- Open questions or debates
- Related concepts ([[wikilinks]])

## Comparison Pages
Side-by-side analyses. Include:
- What is being compared and why
- Dimensions of comparison (table format preferred)
- Verdict or synthesis
- Sources

## Update Policy
When new information conflicts with existing content:
1. Check the dates — newer sources generally supersede older ones
2. If genuinely contradictory, note both positions with dates and sources
3. Mark the contradiction in frontmatter: `contradictions: [page-name]`
4. Flag for user review in the lint report
```

### index.md Template

The index is sectioned by type. Each entry is one line: wikilink + summary.

```markdown
# Wiki Index

> Content catalog. Every wiki page listed under its type with a one-line summary.
> Read this first to find relevant pages for any query.
> Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD | Total pages: N

## Entities
<!-- Alphabetical within section -->

## Concepts

## Comparisons

## Queries
```

**Scaling rule:** When any section exceeds 50 entries, split it into sub-sections
by first letter or sub-domain. When the index exceeds 200 entries total, create
a `_meta/topic-map.md` that groups pages by theme for faster navigation.

### log.md Template

```markdown
# Wiki Log

> Chronological record of all wiki actions. Append-only.
> Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] action | subject`
> Actions: ingest, update, query, lint, create, archive, delete
> When this file exceeds 500 entries, rotate: rename to log-YYYY.md, start fresh.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] create | Wiki initialized
- Domain: [domain]
- Structure created with SCHEMA.md, index.md, log.md
```

## Core Operations

### 1. Ingest

When the user provides a source (URL, file, paste), integrate it into the wiki:

① **Capture the raw source:**
   - URL → use `web_extract` to get markdown, save to `raw/articles/`
   - PDF → use `web_extract` (handles PDFs), save to `raw/papers/`
   - Pasted text → save to appropriate `raw/` subdirectory
   - Name the file descriptively: `raw/articles/karpathy-llm-wiki-2026.md`
   - **Add raw frontmatter** (`source_url`, `ingested`, `sha256` of the body).
     On re-ingest of the same URL: recompute the sha256, compare to the stored value —
     skip if identical, flag drift and update if different. This is cheap enough to
     do on every re-ingest and catches silent source changes.

② **Discuss takeaways** with the user — what's interesting, what matters for
   the domain. (Skip this in automated/cron contexts — proceed directly.)

③ **Check what already exists** — search index.md and use `search_files` to find
   existing pages for mentioned entities/concepts. This is the difference between
   a growing wiki and a pile of duplicates.

④ **Write or update wiki pages:**
   - **New entities/concepts:** Create pages only if they meet the Page Thresholds
     in SCHEMA.md (2+ source mentions, or central to one source)
   - **Existing pages:** Add new information, update facts, bump `updated` date.
     When new info contradicts existing content, follow the Update Policy.
   - **Cross-reference:** Every new or updated page must link to at least 2 other
     pages via `[[wikilinks]]`. Check that existing pages link back.
   - **Tags:** Only use tags from the taxonomy in SCHEMA.md
   - **Provenance:** On pages synthesizing 3+ sources, append `^[raw/articles/source.md]`
     markers to paragraphs whose claims trace to a specific source.
   - **Confidence:** For opinion-heavy, fast-moving, or single-source claims, set
     `confidence: medium` or `low` in frontmatter. Don't mark `high` unless the
     claim is well-supported across multiple sources.

⑤ **Update navigation:**
   - Add new pages to `index.md` under the correct section, alphabetically
   - Update the "Total pages" count and "Last updated" date in index header
   - Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Source Title`
   - List every file created or updated in the log entry

⑥ **Report what changed** — list every file created or updated to the user.

A single source can trigger updates across 5-15 wiki pages. This is normal
and desired — it's the compounding effect.

### 2. Query

When the user asks a question about the wiki's domain:

① **Read `index.md`** to identify relevant pages.
② **For wikis with 100+ pages**, also `search_files` across all `.md` files
   for key terms — the index alone may miss relevant content.
③ **Read the relevant pages** using `read_file`.
④ **Synthesize an answer** from the compiled knowledge. Cite the wiki pages
   you drew from: "Based on [[page-a]] and [[page-b]]..."
⑤ **File valuable answers back** — if the answer is a substantial comparison,
   deep dive, or novel synthesis, create a page in `queries/` or `comparisons/`.
   Don't file trivial lookups — only answers that would be painful to re-derive.
⑥ **Update log.md** with the query and whether it was filed.

### 3. Lint

When the user asks to lint, health-check, or audit the wiki:

① **Orphan pages:** Find pages with no inbound `[[wikilinks]]` from other pages.
```python
# Use execute_code for this — programmatic scan across all wiki pages
import os, re
from collections import defaultdict
wiki = "<WIKI_PATH>"
# Scan all .md files in entities/, concepts/, comparisons/, queries/
# Extract all [[wikilinks]] — build inbound link map
# Pages with zero inbound links are orphans
```

② **Broken wikilinks:** Find `[[links]]` that point to pages that don't exist.

③ **Index completeness:** Every wiki page should appear in `index.md`. Compare
   the filesystem against index entries.

④ **Frontmatter validation:** Every wiki page must have all required fields
   (title, created, updated, type, tags, sources). Tags must be in the taxonomy.

⑤ **Stale content:** Pages whose `updated` date is >90 days older than the most
   recent source that mentions the same entities.

⑥ **Contradictions:** Pages on the same topic with conflicting claims. Look for
   pages that share tags/entities but state different facts. Surface all pages
   with `contested: true` or `contradictions:` frontmatter for user review.

⑦ **Quality signals:** List pages with `confidence: low` and any page that cites
   only a single source but has no confidence field set — these are candidates
   for either finding corroboration or demoting to `confidence: medium`.

⑧ **Source drift:** For each file in `raw/` with a `sha256:` frontmatter, recompute
   the hash and flag mismatches. Mismatches indicate the raw file was edited
   (shouldn't happen — raw/ is immutable) or ingested from a URL that has since
   changed. Not a hard error, but worth reporting.

⑨ **Page size:** Flag pages over 200 lines — candidates for splitting.

⑩ **Tag audit:** List all tags in use, flag any not in the SCHEMA.md taxonomy.

⑪ **Log rotation:** If log.md exceeds 500 entries, rotate it.

⑫ **Report findings** with specific file paths and suggested actions, grouped by
   severity (broken links > orphans > source drift > contested pages > stale content > style issues).

⑬ **Append to log.md:** `## [YYYY-MM-DD] lint | N issues found`

## Working with the Wiki

### Searching

```bash
# Find pages by content
search_files "transformer" path="$WIKI" file_glob="*.md"

# Find pages by filename
search_files "*.md" target="files" path="$WIKI"

# Find pages by tag
search_files "tags:.*alignment" path="$WIKI" file_glob="*.md"

# Recent activity
read_file "$WIKI/log.md" offset=<last 20 lines>
```

### Bulk Ingest

When ingesting multiple sources at once, batch the updates:
1. Read all sources first
2. Identify all entities and concepts across all sources
3. Check existing pages for all of them (one search pass, not N)
4. Create/update pages in one pass (avoids redundant updates)
5. Update index.md once at the end
6. Write a single log entry covering the batch

### Archiving

When content is fully superseded or the domain scope changes:
1. Create `_archive/` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Move the page to `_archive/` with its original path (e.g., `_archive/entities/old-page.md`)
3. Remove from `index.md`
4. Update any pages that linked to it — replace wikilink with plain text + "(archived)"
5. Log the archive action

### Obsidian Integration

The wiki directory works as an Obsidian vault out of the box:
- `[[wikilinks]]` render as clickable links
- Graph View visualizes the knowledge network
- YAML frontmatter powers Dataview queries
- The `raw/assets/` folder holds images referenced via `![[image.png]]`

For best results:
- Set Obsidian's attachment folder to `raw/assets/`
- Enable "Wikilinks" in Obsidian settings (usually on by default)
- Install Dataview plugin for queries like `TABLE tags FROM "entities" WHERE contains(tags, "company")`

If using the Obsidian skill alongside this one, set `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` to the
same directory as the wiki path.

### Obsidian Headless (servers and headless machines)

On machines without a display, use `obsidian-headless` instead of the desktop app.
It syncs vaults via Obsidian Sync without a GUI — perfect for agents running on
servers that write to the wiki while Obsidian desktop reads it on another device.

**Setup:**
```bash
# Requires Node.js 22+
npm install -g obsidian-headless

# Login (requires Obsidian account with Sync subscription)
ob login --email <email> --password '<password>'

# Create a remote vault for the wiki
ob sync-create-remote --name "LLM Wiki"

# Connect the wiki directory to the vault
cd ~/wiki
ob sync-setup --vault "<vault-id>"

# Initial sync
ob sync

# Continuous sync (foreground — use systemd for background)
ob sync --continuous
```

**Continuous background sync via systemd:**
```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/obsidian-wiki-sync.service
[Unit]
Description=Obsidian LLM Wiki Sync
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/ob sync --continuous
WorkingDirectory=%h/wiki
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now obsidian-wiki-sync
# Enable linger so sync survives logout:
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

This lets the agent write to `~/wiki` on a server while you browse the same
vault in Obsidian on your laptop/phone — changes appear within seconds.

## Map of Content (MOC) Pages

When a thematic cluster of 5+ concept pages emerges around a central idea, create a **Map of Content (MOC)** page — a navigational hub that groups related pages by sub-theme with one-line summaries and cross-links.

**When to create a MOC:**
- User asks to "survey," "map," or "investigate" a topic and you find 5+ related pages
- A concept has grown tendrils across entities/, concepts/, comparisons/ — the MOC unifies them
- After a deep investigation session, as a checkpoint artifact

**MOC page conventions:**
- File: `concepts/<topic>-moc.md`
- Type: `concept`
- Tags: include `knowledge-management` alongside domain tags
- Structure: numbered thematic clusters, each with a table of pages + summaries
- Link direction: MOC → all related pages (outbound). Related pages do NOT need to link back to MOC (avoids circular clutter). Exception: the hub concept page should link to MOC in a `## Navigation` section.
- The MOC's `related:` field lists all pages in the cluster for programmatic discovery

**MOC vs hub concept page:** A hub concept page (e.g., `representation-collapse.md`) is the *central argument*. A MOC (e.g., `representation-collapse-moc.md`) is the *navigational map*. Keep them separate — the hub makes the claim, the MOC organizes the territory.

## Hub Concept Naming

**Name the phenomenon, not the person or theory.** When creating a concept page that synthesizes an existing framework (e.g., Baudrillard's Simulacra), the title should describe the *actual phenomenon* for discoverability by people unfamiliar with the source thinker.

- ✅ `Representation Collapse — When Models, Maps, and Proxies Replace Reality`
- ❌ `Baudrillard and AI` (opaque to anyone who doesn't know Baudrillard)

The person/theory name becomes an **alias** in frontmatter for backward compatibility and search. This ensures the concept is discoverable by describing *what happens*, not *who wrote about it*.

## JP→EN Translation Sweeps (cron pattern)

When running a "translate remaining JP files" batch over the wiki:

- **Bodies vs. frontmatter are separate targets.** A body-only scan may report 0 remaining while translatable Japanese still lives in YAML frontmatter (source quotes, `source_messages`, `notes`, page `title`, non-native-script `aliases`). Run BOTH scans: total-file JP count AND body-only JP count; the gap between them is the frontmatter work.
- **Preserve genuine multilingual aliases.** Native-script names kept for search/discoverability (`通义千问` for Qwen, `腾讯` for Tencent, `姚顺雨` for Shunyu Yao) should NOT be "translated" — they are backward-compat aliases. Only translate JP strings that are prose (quotes, notes, titles, descriptive aliases like `セッション可搬性` when an English alias already exists).
- **When bodies are clean and only intentional aliases remain**, the sweep has reached its natural end. Report this clearly and suggest disabling/retargeting the cron job rather than manufacturing work.
- **Exclusions for scans:** skip `raw/`, `_archive/`, `.git`, and fenced code blocks; parse frontmatter by matching the FIRST `---` at line 0 (not "any two `---` lines") or false positives appear.
- **Intentional body JP is not backlog.** Append-only `log.md` entries quoting Japanese titles/proper names, and Japanese person names used for disambiguation on quarantine/verification pages, are content — not untranslated prose. Classify residual body-JP files by inspection before counting them as remaining work; report them separately from "translatable remaining."
- **Sweep-end procedure:** log the natural-end conclusion in `log.md` (this bumps log JP char count slightly — a pre-commit JP warning about this is expected, not an error), commit, push, and explicitly recommend disabling/retargeting the sweep cron in the report.
- **Reusable dual scan:** `references/jp-sweep-scan-script.py` implements the body-vs-frontmatter scan correctly (frontmatter anchored at line 0, skips raw/_archive/.git). Run via terminal with `python3 <path>` rather than hand-rolling the regex each sweep.
- **Watch for stray uncommitted work from other pipelines** in the working tree (e.g., concept pages from active-crawl left unstaged). Translation crons committing only their own files avoid entangling other jobs' WIP; if you do commit strays, fix tag-taxonomy violations surfaced by the pre-commit hook (common: singular `ai-agent` → canonical `ai-agents`) rather than using `--no-verify`.

## Wikilink lint before finishing any ingest (mandatory gate)

A freshly-written page is a link-failure magnet: you guess target slugs (`[[context-rot]]`,
`[[agent-security]]`, `[[apollo-research]]`) that don't exist, and you write **bare slugs**
(`[[transluce]]`) while this wiki's convention is **path-qualified** links
(`[[entities/transluce]]`, `[[concepts/prompt-injection]]`). Both silently degrade the graph.

Before you commit, run a link check across exactly the files you touched:

```python
# /tmp/linklint.py — verify every [[wikilink]] in your new/edited pages resolves
import os, re
root = os.path.expanduser('~/wiki')
pages = set()
for sub in ('entities','concepts','comparisons','queries'):
    for dp,_,fs in os.walk(os.path.join(root,sub)):
        for f in fs:
            if f.endswith('.md'):
                pages.add(os.path.relpath(os.path.join(dp,f),root)[:-3])
pset = set(pages)
for mf in MY_FILES:                       # list the pages you created/edited
    for m in re.findall(r'\[\[([^\]|#]+)', open(os.path.join(root,mf)).read()):
        m = m.strip()[:-3] if m.strip().endswith('.md') else m.strip()
        if m not in pset:
            print('BROKEN', mf, '->', m)
```

- Cron sessions BLOCK `execute_code` (approvals) — write the script to `/tmp` and run it via
  terminal `python3 /tmp/linklint.py`, not `execute_code`.
- When a lint reports a broken target, **find the real slug first** (`search_files "*.md"
  target=files` for the concept) — many topics live in nested subdirs
  (`concepts/harness-engineering/context-engineering.md`, not `concepts/context-engineering.md`).
  Don't invent a plausible path.
- Also lint the `related:` frontmatter field — it references `.md` paths that must exist too,
  and it's easy to list a page you assumed existed (this session cut a nonexistent
  `entities/apollo-research.md` from a new page's `related:`).

## Weekly graph analysis: persist a state snapshot for true set-deltas

Save a JSON snapshot each weekly run to `wiki/_meta/graph-analysis-state.json` containing
`{orphans, broken(targets→source-list), nlines, jitmap(size:mtime:basename dedup key), total, dup groups}`.
Next week diff the SETS (which orphans/dups are new/resolved), not just counts — counts alone
let unresolved items hide (this wiki carried the same 8 duplicate groups and the same
188-ref `concepts/context-engineering` dir-hub for 4 consecutive weeks).

Duplicate classification that avoids false positives (verified 2026-09-25):
- **Group by basename after resolving each page path** — a naive `os.path.basename` dict-overwrite
  silently drops collisions and reports single paths as "dup groups".
- Skip groups where any member is a redirect (`^redirect` in first 400 chars) or <25 lines.
- Separate three classes: (A) true dups needing merge, (B) flat-vs-subdir collisions from dir
  reorganization (~22 were 25L stubs → pure redirect candidates), (C) by-design pairs
  (entity+concept, concept+comparison, dir `index.md` hubs) — never count C as debt.
- `index.md`/`_index.md` hub files show up as dup basenames across dirs — always exclude.

Other confirmed gotchas: report broken refs by resolved target (grouped count) not per-file to
match prior baselines; `related:` frontmatter targets must be linted too (~74 broken); missing-
frontmatter scans must accept BOTH `sources: [a,b]` inline and `sources:\n  - a` block styles or
you'll falsely report thousands of violations; a stale-count spike usually means a bulk-ingest
cohort crossed the 90d line — recommend a per-type threshold policy (entities 180d) instead of
batch touching. Stock `~/.hermes/scripts/wiki_graph_analysis_verified.py` under-reports dir-hub targets;
full classification script pattern: `/tmp/wga/linklint.py` this session (path-missing vs
raw/transcripts-ref vs bare-missing vs related-field).

## Provenance bar on patch-appended claims (re-read the raw you just saved)

When you `patch` an EXISTING page to add a claim sourced from a raw file you just ingested,
verify the claim is actually in the saved raw body before committing — especially under a
compaction or from memory. This session wrote "launched two prototype satellites in Nov 2025
with Blue Origin" into `space-gpus.md` from a half-remembered detail; the raw said
*"learning mission with Planet to launch two prototype satellites **by early 2027**"* (not yet
launched, no Blue Origin). Re-read the raw article section you cite and match dates, partners,
and status verbs (announced vs launched vs planned). Fix the patch, don't keep the flourish.

## Index counts drift because sibling crons create pages mid-session

In a shared `~/ai-topics` tree, other ingestion crons are adding pages while you work, so
`index.md`'s `## Entities (N pages)` headers and `Total pages:` are almost never equal to your
own edits. Recompute the ACTUAL counts from the filesystem (walk `entities/`, `concepts/`, …
and count `.md`) and write those into the section headers + total, rather than incrementing the
header by "6 new pages". The section header is a filesystem truth, not a running tally —
reconciling it to `find`-count each ingest keeps the index honest even as siblings churn.

## Tag mapping quick-ref additions seen this session

`ai-alignment`→`alignment` (+ `ai-safety`); `context-rot` is NOT a taxonomy tag (use
`context-engineering`; the page concept lives under `concepts/harness-engineering/context-engineering`);
`surveillance`/`censorship` are valid; `agent-memory`/`enterprise-ai`/`knowledge-management`/
`information-retrieval`/`rag`/`retrieval` are all valid for enterprise-RAG pages.

## Pitfalls

- **Never modify files in `raw/`** — sources are immutable. Corrections go in wiki pages.
- **Search scope for wiki content** — When investigating "wiki content on X," don't limit search to `wiki/` subdirectories. The ai-topics repo also has `blog/` (published articles), `inbox/`, `transcripts/`, and top-level directories that contain relevant material. A file reported as "missing" may simply be outside `wiki/`. Always check `git log --all --oneline -- "path"` before reporting a file as deleted.
- **Always orient first** — read SCHEMA + index + recent log before any operation in a new session.
  Skipping this causes duplicates and missed cross-references.
- **Always update index.md and log.md** — skipping this makes the wiki degrade. These are the
  navigational backbone.
- **Cron sessions may block execute_code** — if `approvals.cron_mode` is unset, `execute_code`
  is refused in unattended cron jobs. Run helper Python via terminal heredoc instead
  (`cat > /tmp/x.py << 'EOF' ... EOF && python3 /tmp/x.py`). The `patch` tool still works.
- **Don't create pages for passing mentions** — follow the Page Thresholds in SCHEMA.md. A name
  appearing once in a footnote doesn't warrant an entity page.
- **Don't create pages without cross-references** — isolated pages are invisible. Every page must
  link to at least 2 other pages.
- **Frontmatter is required** — it enables search, filtering, and staleness detection.
- **Tags must come from the taxonomy** — freeform tags decay into noise. Add new tags to SCHEMA.md
  first, then use them.
- **Keep pages scannable** — a wiki page should be readable in 30 seconds. Split pages over
  200 lines. Move detailed analysis to dedicated deep-dive pages.
- **Ask before mass-updating** — if an ingest would touch 10+ existing pages, confirm
  the scope with the user first.
- **Rotate the log** — when log.md exceeds 500 entries, rename it `log-YYYY.md` and start fresh.
  The agent should check log size during lint.

## arXiv ingestion (active-crawl / scheduled research)

When ingesting recent arXiv papers (the `active-crawl` job and any "find arXiv sources" task):

- **Prefer the arXiv Atom API over scraping `/html/`.** `https://arxiv.org/html/<id>v<n>` 404s for
  very recent papers and is unreliable to fetch. Use the stable Atom endpoint instead — it returns
  authors, abstract, dates, and the **correct arXiv ID**:
  `curl 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?id_list=<id1>,<id2>'` (parse the Atom XML; namespace
  `http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom`). Save the abstract as the raw source with `source_url` + `sha256`.
- **Verify the arXiv ID, never trust notes-from-memory across a compaction.** A transcript ID can be
  a typo. Confirm by title search:
  `curl 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:%22<exact title phrase>%22'`. This
  session corrected `2609.21208` → `2609.20812` only because the ID was re-checked, not assumed.
- **Apply a provenance bar before creating a page.** Drop scanner-blocked `.dev` sites, HN memes /
  stunt posts, and anything without a durable original source. Log dropped candidates in `log.md`
  rather than fabricating a page from a thin source.

## Committing wiki changes in a shared working tree (cron with concurrent sibling pipelines)

Multiple ingestion crons can leave their own WIP staged/modified in `~/ai-topics` at the same time.

- **Commit only your own files** by explicit path after `git reset -q` (the working tree may already
  have other jobs' `git add` output staged — don't assume `git add wiki/` only captures your work).
- **Push cleanly past sibling WIP:** the pre-commit hook validates tags, so if a *sibling's*
  index/log edits trip it while you commit, `git stash push -u -m "<desc>"`, then
  `git pull --rebase && git push`, then `git stash pop`. `git pull --rebase` fails outright on any
  unstaged changes ("cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes") — the stash is the fix,
  not `--no-verify`.
- **A sibling may have modified the file you're about to patch** (write_file/patch surface a
  "modified since you last read it" warning). Re-read before the final index/log write if warned.
- **Pre-dry-run the hook instead of discovering it on commit:** the ai-topics hook runs from
  `core.hooksPath = .githooks` (NOT `.git/hooks`). After `git add` your files but BEFORE the
  real `git commit`, run `.githooks/pre-commit` to surface tag-taxonomy or shrink violations
  early. Fix the offending frontmatter, re-`git add`, then commit. This avoids a blocked commit
  mid-push and the stash dance below.
- **Stash round-trip is a 3-step discipline, not one:** if you `git stash push -u` to clear
  sibling WIP, you MUST `git stash pop` at the very end to restore it (verify with `git stash
  list` — it should be empty). A cron that stashes to push cleanly but never pops silently
  discards another pipeline's uncommitted work.

## Tag taxonomy violations (wiki pre-commit hook)

The ai-topics wiki pre-commit hook blocks commits whose page `tags:` aren't in `SCHEMA.md`'s
taxonomy. Don't `--no-verify` — map to the canonical singular/canonical form. Confirmed across
sessions: `harness`→`agent-harness`, `agent-oversight`→`agent-observability`,
`open-weights`→`open-weight`, `ai-agent`→`ai-agents`, `data`→`datasets` (or `training` /
`synthetic-data` / `corpus` per the claim). Plain `data` is NEVER a valid tag — it only appears
in SCHEMA.md as prose and inside `open-data`/`private-data`. Grep `SCHEMA.md` for a tag before
assuming a plural, singular, or generic-word variant exists; several canonical tags are
counterintuitive (`open-weight` not `open-weights`, `datasets` not `data`). When a tag-word is
ambiguous, grep with word boundaries (`\bword\b`) to distinguish a real taxonomy entry from
incidental prose or a compound (`open-data`).

## Never overwrite a rich page with a skeleton (hard pre-commit gate)

Per the ai-topics `AGENTS.md`: any existing `entities/` / `concepts/` page over ~40 lines MUST be
edited with `read_file` + `patch`, never `write_file`. The pre-commit hook detects and blocks a
>50% shrink, so a skeleton overwrite fails the commit *and* risks destroying accumulated knowledge.
When enriching, patch-append sections and bump `updated` rather than rewriting the body.

## Working directory

The runner sets the working directory to ~/ai-topics and supplies the portable contract. Use ~/wiki for all wiki operations.

## Related Tools

[llm-wiki-compiler](https://github.com/atomicmemory/llm-wiki-compiler) is a Node.js CLI that
compiles sources into a concept wiki with the same Karpathy inspiration. It's Obsidian-compatible,
so users who want a scheduled/CLI-driven compile pipeline can point it at the same vault this
skill maintains. Trade-offs: it owns page generation (replaces the agent's judgment on page
creation) and is tuned for small corpora. Use this skill when you want agent-in-the-loop curation;
use llmwiki when you want batch compile of a source directory.
