# Web Supplement Fetch — robust recipes for Phase 1b supplementation

Verified 2026-08-10 (trending-topics cron run). Use when the RSS scan yields few
AI-relevant articles, or when you need breaking headlines beyond the pipeline
(model releases, security incidents, HN front-page signals).

## 1. Verify delegated web_search actually ran

When using `delegate_task` with `toolsets: ['web']`, the subagent may return its
*plan* ("I'll search for X...") instead of executed results. Check the result object:

- `tool_trace: []` + only 1 API call → no searches were executed → discard and fall back.
- Do not burn turns retrying delegation blindly; go straight to direct fetch below.

## 2. Direct fetch pattern (works in cron; execute_code is blocked)

Write a Python script to `/tmp/` with `write_file`, run with `python3 /tmp/xxx.py`
via `terminal`. No shell pipes involved.

**Pitfall**: `curl ... | python3 -c ...` pipes are BLOCKED by the Hermes security
scanner (`tirith:curl_pipe_shell`, HIGH — "Downloaded content will be executed without
inspection"). Two safe alternatives:
  a) `curl -s -o /tmp/out.json URL` then read/parse the file in a separate step.
  b) Python urllib inside the script (no pipe at all — preferred).

**Pitfall (verified 2026-08-23)**: the security scanner also blocks `cat file.json |
python3 -c "import json,sys; ..."` on ANY local file — even a small checkpoint JSON
under `~/.hermes/cron/data/`. Pattern key: `tirith:pipe_to_interpreter` (HIGH, "Pipes
output from 'cat' directly to interpreter"). The 2026-08-16 warning that "even
`cat latest.json | python3 -c` is blocked" is not theoretical — it fired on a live
`~/.hermes/cron/data/blog_ingest/latest.json` read this run. Do NOT use cat-pipes for
checkpoint parsing. Use one of:
  - `json.load(open(...))` inside a script written to `/tmp/` with `write_file` (preferred),
  - read the file with `read_file`,
  - or `curl -s -o /tmp/out.json` / plain file copy, then parse in a separate step.

The scanner fires on the pipe syntax itself regardless of whether the input is remote
or local. The rule generalizes: never pipe anything into an interpreter; fetch/copy
to a file first, then parse it in a separate step.

## 3. Hacker News front-page recipe (top trending tech signal)

```python
import json, urllib.request, time

def fetch(url):
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=25) as r:
        return json.loads(r.read().decode())

since = int(time.time()) - 3*86400
d = fetch(f"https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?tags=front_page&numericFilters=created_at_i%3E{since}")
for h in d.get("hits", [])[:30]:
    print(f"- {h.get('points')} | {h.get('title','')[:110]} | {h.get('url') or '(ask)'}")
```

CRITICAL: the `>` in `numericFilters` must be URL-encoded as `%3E`. A raw `>` in the
URL (especially with shell expansion) → `400 Bad Request` from hn.algolia.com.

## 4. Generic page fetch (get article body when titles aren't enough)

```python
import urllib.request, re, html

def fetch(url):
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36"})
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=25) as r:
        return r.read().decode("utf-8", errors="replace")

def strip_html(s):
    s = re.sub(r"<script[\s\S]*?</script>", " ", s)
    s = re.sub(r"<style[\s\S]*?</style>", " ", s)
    s = re.sub(r"<[^>]+>", " ", s)
    s = html.unescape(s)
    return re.sub(r"\s+", " ", s).strip()
```

Nav-heavy sites (claude.com, research.meta.ai) return navigation menus in the first
~2500 chars of stripped text — the article body follows the page title; read past the
menu (print `text[:2500]`, and the meaningful content starts after the title line).

**Pitfall (verified 2026-08-27, OpenAI post-mortem): the "filter lines > N chars" body
extraction silently returns 0 chars when the whole article is one text blob.** Some
sites (OpenAI, most JS-rendered SPA-style posts) strip to a single long line — the
header + entire article body are concatenated with no `\n`. A pattern like:

```python
lines = [l.strip() for l in t.split("\n") if len(l.strip()) > 40]
```

…produces a 1-element list and any `find("In July 2026")` against it returns -1 →
you write a 168-byte raw file with just the header. **Diagnosis:** if your
post-strip line count is < 5 and `len(body) < 500`, the article is a single blob.
**Fix:** use `str.find` on the raw stripped text (NOT on the line-filtered list) and
slice between the body-start marker and the footer marker:

```python
idx = text.find("In July 2026")          # first body sentence
end = text.find("2026 Alignment Authors") # footer / author line
body = text[idx:end]
```

The raw-file byte count should be ≥ 5KB for a substantial article; anything under
2KB is a near-certain extraction failure — re-extract before saving to
`wiki/raw/articles/`.

## 5. Cross-referencing before wiki work

The wiki-ingest pipelines (newsletter-wiki-ingest ~07:40, blog-wiki-ingest ~07:50,
x-bookmarks-ingest, active-crawl) usually run BEFORE trending-topics (~12:00 UTC).
Before proposing new wiki pages, grep the index for today's topics:

```bash
cd ~/wiki && grep -inE "topic|entity" index.md | head -20
```

If the entry exists with today's date, reference the existing page in the report
instead of creating a duplicate.
