# GetXAPI Fallback for X Articles

X Articles (long-form posts at `x.com/i/article/<id>`) are **not regular tweets** from the X API's perspective. The X API v2 `/tweets` endpoint cannot resolve article IDs, and xurl returns either:
- `"Could not find tweet with id"` if you query the article ID directly
- Metadata-only (title, author, engagement) without the body if you query the parent tweet

**GetXAPI** (`api.getxapi.com`) provides a dedicated endpoint that returns the full article body as structured JSON blocks (headings, paragraphs, lists, images, inline styles).

## Command

```bash
curl -s -H"Authorization: Bearer $GETXAPI_KEY" \
  "https://api.getxapi.com/twitter/tweet/article?id=<TWEET_ID>"
```

Where `<TWEET_ID>` is the **parent tweet's ID** (the tweet that links to/contains the article), NOT the article ID.

### Content Block Types

| type | Meaning | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| `header-two` | Section heading | `## <text>` in markdown |
| `unstyled` | Paragraph text | Plain paragraph |
| `unordered-list-item` | Bullet point | `- <text>` with raw inline styles |
| `image` | Embedded image | Omit in text version (include URL in frontmatter) |
| `atomic` | Entity block (tables, embeds) | Usually empty text, skip |

### Inline Style Ranges

Each `unstyled` block may have `inlineStyleRanges`:
```json
"inlineStyleRanges": [
  {"length": 49, "offset": 0, "style": "Bold"},
  {"length": 103, "offset": 0, "style": "Italic"}
]
```
Available styles: `"Bold"`, `"Italic"`.

## Retrieval Strategy — Six Tiers

When encountering an X Article URL (`x.com/user/status/NNN` linking to `x.com/i/article/...`):

### Tier 0: Bookmark JSON `article.plain_text` (zero-cost, zero-API) ⭐ ALWAYS CHECK FIRST

When processing bookmarks from the `x-bookmarks-ingest` cron pipeline (`fetch_x_bookmarks.py`), the incoming bookmark JSON already contains `article.plain_text` — the FULL article body extracted by the pre-run script. **Check this before any API call.**

```python
# In the bookmark JSON from fetch_x_bookmarks.py output:
bookmark["article"]["plain_text"]  # ~2KB-15KB of full article text
```

The pre-run script calls `xurl --auth oauth2 "/2/tweets/<ID>?tweet.fields=article"` and stores `article.plain_text` in the output JSON. If `article.plain_text` has substantial content (>2KB), save it directly as the raw article — **no Tier 1/1.5/2/3/4 needed.**

Validated successes:
- camelAI architecture deep-dive (July 2026): ~10KB of full article text from `article.plain_text`, saved directly.
- Varick Agents "AI Adoption is a Myth" (Aug 2026): ~11.5KB, saved directly with zero API calls.

**Manual (interactive) ingestion has no bookmark JSON** — when the user pastes an X Article URL directly (not from the bookmark pipeline), skip Tier 0 and go straight to Tier 1.5. It works for corporate/brand accounts (e.g. @UberEng) as well as personal accounts, and one call returns body + engagement metadata for the frontmatter. See `references/ubereng-software-factory-case-study.md`.

Only proceed to lower tiers when `article.plain_text` is missing, empty, or too short to be useful.

### Tier 1: xurl metadata (fast, free)
```bash
xurl read <TWEET_ID>
```
Returns: article title, author info, engagement metrics (likes, retweets, bookmarks, impressions). **Does NOT return body text.** The `article` field will have `{title}` only — no `plain_text`. Useful for quick triage and raw article frontmatter.

**CRITICAL**: `xurl read` ≠ `xurl --auth oauth2 "/2/tweets/ID?tweet.fields=article"`. Tier 1 (this) only gets metadata. Tier 1.5 (below) gets the full body. The difference is `--auth oauth2` and explicit `?tweet.fields=article`.

### Tier 1.5: xurl with article fields (fast, full body via OAuth2) ⭐ PREFERRED
```bash
xurl --auth oauth2 "/2/tweets/<TWEET_ID>?tweet.fields=article"
```
Returns: article title + **full `plain_text` body** + `preview_text` + `cover_media` + `entities` (referenced tweets, URLs). This is the most reliable and fastest way to get the **complete article body** without a third-party API. Requires OAuth2 user authentication.

The response structure:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "article": {
      "title": "...",
      "plain_text": "Full article body text here...",
      "preview_text": "I asked a simple question...",
      "cover_media": "3_...",
      "entities": { "tweets": [...], "urls": [...] }
    },
    "text": "https://t.co/...",
    "id": "2056598291316634079"
  }
}
```

**Key distinction**: This Tier is `--auth oauth2` + explicit `tweet.fields=article`. The simpler `xurl read <ID>` (Tier 1) returns `article: {title}` without `plain_text`. The `fetch_x_bookmarks.py` script at `~/.hermes/scripts/fetch_x_bookmarks.py` uses this exact pattern in its `fetch_article_body()` function (line 103-129).

### Tier 2: web_extract preview (medium effort, partial body)
```python
web_extract(url="https://x.com/user/status/<TWEET_ID>")
```
Returns: first several paragraphs of the article text plus metadata. Good enough for wiki summaries and concept extraction when full text isn't critical. **Note:** This Tier is a fallback when Tier 1.5 fails (e.g., OAuth2 auth not working, or the article endpoint returns HTTP 500). Tier 1.5 is preferred as it returns the complete body.

### Tier 3: GetXAPI full body (complete, requires API key)
Use when you need the full structured article content with section headings, inline styles, and image URLs. See the Workflow section below.

**If GETXAPI_KEY is not set**, skip Tier 3 and go directly to Tier 4.

### Tier 4: Secondary source discovery (when GetXAPI unavailable)

**⚠️ Cron-mode limitation**: `web_search` is NOT available in cron jobs. Tier 4 is effectively unreachable from `x-bookmarks-ingest` and `x-accounts-scan` cron pipelines. In cron mode, if Tier 0 (`article.plain_text`) is empty and Tiers 1-3 fail, the article cannot be recovered — save as metadata-only and move on. Tier 4 works in interactive sessions only.

When direct retrieval fails (no GETXAPI key, browser unavailable, cookie wall, nitter down), use **web_search** to find news outlets or blogs that published summaries or translations of the article:

```python
web_search(query="<author name> \"<article title>\" <year>")
```

**Effective search patterns:**
- `"<exact article title>" <author handle>` — finds exact matches
- `<author name> <topic keywords>` — finds broader coverage
- Non-English outlets often publish comprehensive summaries (e.g., Chinese tech media like ABMedia 鏈新聞 for high-profile AI articles)

**What to look for in search results:**
- News outlet summaries that reproduce key quotes and structure
- Blog posts that analyze/reference the article with detailed excerpts
- GitHub issues/discussions that quote substantial portions
- Forum threads (Reddit, HN) with user summaries

**Known secondary-source domains for coding-agent articles:**
- **mem0.ai/blog** — Mem0 regularly publishes detailed analysis of agent memory tools (Codex, LangChain, LlamaIndex). When an X Article covers agent memory/harness features, check mem0.ai first — they often republish with full technical depth and working code.
- **blog.langchain.com** — Common mirror for agent engineering articles
- **zylos.ai/research** — Deep architectural analysis of coding agent harnesses
- **abmedia.io** — Chinese tech media with comprehensive English article summaries

**After finding a secondary source:**
1. `web_extract` the secondary article for full content
2. Mark the raw article with `getxapi: false` and `source_fallback: secondary` in frontmatter
3. Add `summary_source: <url>` and `summary_source_name: <outlet name>` to document where the reconstructed content came from
4. Note in the raw article body that content is reconstructed from secondary sources

**Full retrieval chain (tried in order):**
Tier 0 (bookmark `article.plain_text`) → Tier 1 (xurl metadata) → Tier 2 (web_extract tweet URL) → Tier 3 (GetXAPI) → browser_navigate → web_extract article URL → xcancel/nitter → **Tier 4 (web_search → secondary source)** ✅

**Real example (Garry Tan "Meta-Meta-Prompting"):**
- Tiers 1-3 + browser + nitter all failed
- `web_search('Garry Tan "Meta-Meta-Prompting" AI Agents 2026')` → found ABMedia (abmedia.io) Chinese summary
- `web_extract` on ABMedia → comprehensive article with all key concepts, quotes, and architecture details
- Result: produced a complete raw article and concept page from secondary source alone

## Workflow

### Step 0: Quick triage
```bash
xurl read <TWEET_ID>
```
If the response contains `article.title`, it's an X Article (not a regular tweet). Extract the title, author, and engagement metrics from this response.

### Step 1: Extract the tweet ID from the URL
```python
# URL pattern: https://x.com/user/status/2050038277454143918
tweet_id = url.split("/status/")[1].split("?")[0]
```

### Step 2: Fetch article via curl

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Use `terminal` tool with shell variable expansion, NOT `execute_code`.** The `execute_code` tool does NOT inherit environment variables from `${HERMES_HOME}/.env` — `os.environ.get("GETXAPI_KEY")` will return an empty string. The `terminal` tool does inherit shell environment.

**Method A — Terminal (preferred, works reliably):**
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $GETXAPI_KEY" \
  "https://api.getxapi.com/twitter/tweet/article?id=<TWEET_ID>" \
  > /tmp/hermes_article.json
```
Then process the saved JSON with `execute_code` (no env var needed for file I/O):
```python
import json
with open("/tmp/hermes_article.json") as f:
    data = json.load(f)
article = data["article"]
```

**Method B — execute_code (only if you've confirmed the env var is available):**
First verify: `echo ${GETXAPI_KEY:-(not set)}` in terminal. If set, the key is in `${HERMES_HOME}/.env` but `execute_code` still won't see it — use Method A.

### Step 3: Convert to markdown for raw article
```python
lines = []
for block in article["contents"]:
    t = block["type"]
    text = block.get("text", "").strip()
    if t == "header-two" and text:
        lines.append(f"\n## {text}\n")
    elif t == "unstyled" and text:
        lines.append(f"{text}\n")
    elif t == "unordered-list-item" and text:
        lines.append(f"- {text}")

markdown = "\n".join(lines)
```

### Step 4: Update frontmatter
Mark the article with `getxapi: true` and `source_fallback: false` (to indicate the body WAS retrieved, unlike a pure metadata-only fallback).

## Before/After Comparison

| Aspect | Bookmark JSON (T0) | xurl read (T1) | xurl + article fields (T1.5) | xurl + GetXAPI (T3+) |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Article title | ✅ `article.title` | ✅ `article.title` | ✅ Same | ✅ Same |
| **Article body** | ✅ Full `article.plain_text` | ❌ Not available | ✅ Full `plain_text` | ✅ With section structure |
| Author metadata | ✅ From bookmark | ✅ Basic | ✅ Basic | ✅ Rich (followers, bio, blue check) |
| Engagement metrics | ✅ From bookmark | ✅ like/RT/reply/bookmark | ✅ Same | ✅ Same + view count |
| Inline formatting | ❌ Plain text only | N/A | ❌ Plain text only | ✅ Bold/italic ranges |
| Embedded images | ✅ Cover media ID | N/A | ✅ Cover media ID | ✅ URLs with dimensions |
| Cost | Free (pre-fetched) | Free (X API credits) | Free (X API credits) | Paid (GetXAPI) |
| Reliability | Highest (already fetched) | Highest | High | Medium (depends on 3rd party) |
| API call needed | None — already in JSON | 1 xurl call | 1 xurl call | 1 xurl + 1 curl |

## Pitfalls

- **GetXAPI endpoint requires Authorization** — As of 2026-05-19, `api.getxapi.com/twitter/tweet/article` returns `{"error":"Missing Authorization header"}` (HTTP 200, not 404). The endpoint is LIVE but requires `Authorization: Bearer $GETXAPI_KEY`. If `GETXAPI_KEY` is not set in environment, skip to Tier 4. If the endpoint returns 404 or 500, also skip to Tier 4. The GitHub repo `xhuisme/getxapi` may have updates on key provisioning.
- **HTTP 500 from X servers** — When the X article itself returns HTTP 500 (X server-side error), ALL direct retrieval methods (xurl, web_extract, GetXAPI, browser) will fail. Go straight to Tier 4 (secondary source discovery via web_search).
- **GetXAPI KEY must be in environment** — Use `$GETXAPI_KEY` which is stored in `${HERMES_HOME}/.env`. Verify it's set before calling: `echo ${GETXAPI_KEY:-(not set)}`. If not set, skip Tier 3 and go directly to Tier 4 (secondary source discovery).
- **`execute_code` does NOT inherit `.env` variables** — `os.environ.get("GETXAPI_KEY")` in Python returns `""` because the `execute_code` sandbox has a clean environment. Always use `terminal` with shell variable expansion (`$GETXAPI_KEY`) for API calls. Save the JSON output to a temp file, then process it with `execute_code` for the conversion step.
- **Secondary sources vary in quality** — Machine-translated summaries may miss nuance. Prefer English-language tech media or bilingual outlets. Always note `summary_source` and `source_fallback: secondary` in frontmatter.
- **Rate limits** — GetXAPI has its own rate limits (typically generous but not unlimited). Cache results on first fetch.
- **Article vs tweet ID confusion** — The endpoint takes the **tweet ID** (the status post that links to the article), NOT the article entity ID. If you pass the article ID, it will fail.
- **Image-only content** — `type: "image"` blocks contain image URLs but no alt text. Just note the URL in the markdown or skip inline rendering.
- **Inline styles need manual reconstruction** — `inlineStyleRanges` are offsets into the raw text. The most reliable approach is to skip complex style reconstruction in the saved raw article and just save the text as-is — the raw article is for reference, not publication.
- **Preview text duplication** — The `preview_text` field often duplicates the first `unstyled` block. Don't double-include it.
- **Compliance note** — GetXAPI is a third-party data broker. Content retrieved this way may have different ToS constraints than direct X API access.
- **Secondary sources vary in quality** — Machine-translated summaries may miss nuance. Prefer English-language tech media or bilingual outlets. Always note `summary_source` and `source_fallback: secondary` in frontmatter.
- **Invisible Unicode in article content** — X Article `plain_text` (from Tier 1.5 xurl) frequently contains invisible Unicode (U+200B zero-width space, etc.) that triggers the cron injection scanner. `fetch_x_bookmarks.py` sanitizes via `_sanitize_dict()`. If GetXAPI content also has these chars, sanitize with the same `_INVISIBLE_CHARS` strip set before passing to the agent prompt.

## Supporting References

- `references/canonical-blog-url-fallback.md` — When an X Article bookmark links to content originally published on the author's blog (Substack, personal site, Medium), skip the X article wrapper and web_search → web_extract the canonical URL instead.
- `references/garry-tan-case-study.md` — Full walkthrough of the 8-step retrieval chain that succeeded via Tier 4 secondary source discovery, with the Garry Tan "Meta-Meta-Prompting" article as a worked example.

- `references/thariq-claude-code-skills-case-study.md` — Clean Tier 3 GetXAPI success path: web_extract → GetXAPI full body → raw article → concept page with mechanism + role taxonomy. Thariq Shihipar's "Lessons from Building Claude Code: How We Use Skills" as a worked example.
- `references/ubereng-software-factory-case-study.md` — Clean Tier 1.5 success on a corporate-account X Article (Uber Engineering, Aug 2026): single xurl OAuth2 call returns full body + metadata; manual (non-bookmark) ingestion; enriching existing concept pages instead of creating a standalone page.
