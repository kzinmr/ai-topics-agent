# Orphan Page Deletion Example

Real-world example of deleting orphaned stub page `concepts/code-hoarding/knowledge-accumulation.md`.

## Context

- **Target**: `wiki/concepts/code-hoarding/knowledge-accumulation.md` (24 lines, stub page)
- **Directory**: `wiki/concepts/code-hoarding/` (single file)
- **Reason**: Orphaned stub with no backlinks, not registered in index

## Orphan Detection Results

### Backlink Search
```bash
search_files(pattern="code-hoarding/knowledge-accumulation", target="content", path="~/wiki")
# Result: 0 matches (no backlinks)
```

### Index Registration Check
```bash
search_files(pattern="code-hoarding/knowledge-accumulation", target="content", path="~/wiki/index.md")
# Result: 0 matches (not in index)
```

### Log Records Check
```bash
search_files(pattern="knowledge-accumulation", target="content", path="~/wiki/log.md")
# Result: 0 matches (no creation/update records)
```

## Existing Related Page

- **Location**: `wiki/concepts/harness-engineering/agentic-workflows/code-hoarding.md`
- **Status**: `status: complete` (60 lines)
- **Backlinks**: 7 references from other pages

## Decision Criteria Met

✅ **No backlinks**: 0 references found
✅ **Not in index**: No entry in index.md

- **No log.md update needed**: Page had no creation record

## Lessons Learned

1. **Stub pages**: Pages with `status: stub` and no backlinks are candidates for deletion
2. **Alternative coverage**: If same concept exists elsewhere, orphan stub can be removed
3. **Minimal impact**: Orphan deletion requires no index/log updates if never registered
4. **Directory cleanup**: Always remove empty directories after file deletion
