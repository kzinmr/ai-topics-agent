# Skill Archive Safety & Management

## Skill Inventory Management

### Managed vs Unmanaged Skills
- **Managed (git-tracked)**: Live in `~/ai-topics/config/hermes/skills/` — these are version-controlled and syncable
- **Unmanaged (local)**: Live in `~/.hermes/skills/` — these are runtime skills not yet committed to the repo
- **Archive convention**: Unmanaged skills in `.archive` subdirectories (e.g., `~/.hermes/skills/.archive/baoyu-comic/`) are deprecated but still counted as unmanaged in inventory checks

### Promotion Workflow (Unmanaged → Managed)

**HEALTH CHECK — run first, do not blindly "promote everything unmanaged":**
The unmanaged count is ~95 by design and does NOT mean there is work to do. Before
suggesting any promotions, bucket every unmanaged skill:
- **already canonical** — content already lives in a managed umbrella skill or in
  `AGENTS.md`/`SCHEMA.md` (e.g. `himalaya` vs the AGENTS.md email mandate, `linear`/`airtable`
  under the `productivity` umbrellas). No action; archiving them is what makes them show up
  as "removed" noise later.
- **generic Hermes builtins** — `ascii-art`, `baoyu-*`, `comfyui`, `excalidraw`, `p5js`,
  `pixel-art`, `manim-video`, `pokemon-player`, `minecraft-modpack-server`, `godmode`,
  `openhue`, `imessage`/`findmy`/`apple-*` (no macOS host here). Not AI-topics knowledge;
  leave local or archive, never promote.
- **genuinely new + reusable AI-topics workflow knowledge** — the only real promotion
  candidates. This bucket has been empty for every check to date.
Assume the answer is "nothing to promote" and justify each exception.

When new unmanaged skills are identified during inventory checks:
1. **Assess value**: Does the skill encode reusable workflow knowledge (not session-specific hacks)?
2. **Check for duplicates**: `find ~/ai-topics/config/hermes/skills -type d -name "<skill-name>"` — don't promote if a managed version already exists
3. **Copy to managed**: `cp -r ~/.hermes/skills/<category>/<skill-name>/ ~/ai-topics/config/hermes/skills/<category>/<skill-name>/`
4. **Verify frontmatter**: Ensure YAML frontmatter has `name`, `description`, `category` fields
5. **Commit**: `cd ~/ai-topics && git add config/hermes/skills/ && git commit -m "skills: promote <name>" && git push`
6. **Archive original**: Move the local copy to `~/.hermes/skills/.archive/<skill-name>/` to prevent future inventory noise

### Inventory Check Commands
```bash
# Canonical baseline state used by check_new_skills.py (authoritative for diffs):
#   ~/.hermes/scripts/cache/skills_baseline.json
# Verify it against the live tree before trusting a cron report:
python3 -c "
import json, pathlib
base=json.load(open('~/.hermes/scripts/cache/skills_baseline.json'))
skills=pathlib.Path('~/.hermes/skills')
actual={}
for sm in skills.rglob('SKILL.md'):
    if '.archive' in sm.parts: continue
    parts=sm.parent.relative_to(skills).parts
    if len(parts)==2: actual[parts[1]]=parts[0]
    elif len(parts)==1: actual[parts[0]]='uncategorized'
print('baseline',len(base),'actual',len(actual))
print('stale:',sorted(k for k in base if k not in actual))
print('new:',sorted(k for k in actual if k not in base))
"

# Count managed skills (git-tracked)
find ~/ai-topics/config/hermes/skills -name SKILL.md | wc -l

# IMPORTANT: archived skills must have SKILL.md RENAMED (e.g. SKILL.md.disabled).
# `.archive` is in the path, so rglob-based finders already skip them, but a plain
# `find ~/.hermes/skills -name SKILL.md` will still count them — do not use that
# count as the unmanaged total.
```

# Count unmanaged skills (local runtime)
find ~/.hermes/skills -name "SKILL.md" | wc -l

# Find archived skills (deprecated but present)
find ~/.hermes/skills/.archive -name "SKILL.md" | wc -l

# Check for skill name collisions (can cause ambiguous load errors)
find ~/.hermes ~/ai-topics/config/hermes/skills -type d | sed 's|/SKILL.md||' | sort | uniq -d
```

### Removal Criteria
Skills should be archived (not deleted) when:
- Superseded by a newer umbrella skill
- Referenced by active cron jobs (check `~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json`)
- Contain reusable workflow knowledge not captured elsewhere

Skills can be deleted when:
- One-off session artifacts with no generalizable knowledge
- Fully duplicated in another skill's `references/` directory
- Obsolete tool workflows (deprecated APIs, removed features)

## CRITICAL: Pre-Flight Checklist

**NEVER skip this checklist before ANY skill operation (archive, delete, move, rename).**

### 1. Check cron references (MANDATORY)

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
with open('~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
target = 'TARGET_SKILL'
for j in data['jobs']:
    skills = j.get('skills', [])
    skill = j.get('skill') or ''
    if target in skills or target in skill:
        print(f'BLOCKED: {j[\"name\"]} references {target}')
"
```

### 2. Check config.yaml references
```bash
grep -r "TARGET_SKILL" ~/.hermes/config.yaml 2>/dev/null
```

### 3. Check AGENTS.md / SCHEMA.md references
```bash
grep -r "TARGET_SKILL" ~/ai-topics/AGENTS.md ~/wiki/SCHEMA.md 2>/dev/null
```

### 4. Check other skills for dependencies
```bash
grep -r "TARGET_SKILL" ~/.hermes/skills/*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null
```

## Rules

1. **NEVER** archive/delete a skill referenced by any active cron job
2. **NEVER** archive/delete a skill referenced in AGENTS.md or SCHEMA.md
3. **ALWAYS** check cron-jobs.json before any skill operation
4. **ALWAYS** commit skill changes to repo immediately after modification
5. If a skill is referenced but no longer needed, update the cron job FIRST

## Recovery Procedure

If a skill was accidentally removed:
1. Check git history: `git log --oneline -- config/hermes/skills/SKILL_NAME/`
2. Restore: `git checkout COMMIT -- config/hermes/skills/SKILL_NAME/`
3. Verify cron reference: Run pre-flight checklist above
4. Commit: `git commit -m "fix: restore SKILL_NAME (cron-required)"`
